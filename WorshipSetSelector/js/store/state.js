            lyrics: `No place I would rather be
                \nNo place I would rather be
                \nNo place I would rather be
                \nThen here in Your love, here in Your love
                \n\nSet a fire down in my soul
                \nThat I can't contain and I can't control
                \nI want more of You God
                \nI want more of You God
            `},

            lyrics: `Lord I don't want to rush on ahead
                \nIn my own strength
                \nWhen You're right here
                \n\nI'm not in a hurry
                \nWhen it comes to Your spirit
                \nWhen it comes to Your presence
                \nWhen it comes to Your voice
                \n\nI'm learning to listen
                \nJust to rest in Your nearness
                \nI'm starting to notice
                \nYou are speaking
            `}
