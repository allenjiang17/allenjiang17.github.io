                No place I would rather be
                No place I would rather be
                Then here in Your love, here in Your love
                \nSet a fire down in my soul
                That I can't contain and I can't control
                I want more of You God
                I want more of You God

            lyrics: `Lord I don't want to rush on ahead
                In my own strength
                When You're right here
                \nI'm not in a hurry
                When it comes to Your spirit
                When it comes to Your presence
                When it comes to Your voice
                \nI'm learning to listen
                Just to rest in Your nearness
                I'm starting to notice
                You are speaking
            `}
