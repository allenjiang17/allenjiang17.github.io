## TODO

* Decide State
  * how to store the data (i.e., is a song just a string?)
  * decide actions/mutations + their keys (so we can begin to work on different parts of UI and subscribe, etc.)
* Resizeable windows
* Presentation Window
* License?

## How to Start

* Local Testing
 * run `npx http-server` in this directory
 * You can't directly open index.html because of CORS
 * Sometimes you need to use `cmd + shift + r` to hard refresh the page for the changes to go through.
