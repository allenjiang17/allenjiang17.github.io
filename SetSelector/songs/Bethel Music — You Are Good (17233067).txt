[Verse 1]
A                                            D
I want to scream it out, from every mountain top
                                                   F#m
Your goodness knows no bounds, Your goodness never stops
                                     E/G#     A
Your mercy follows me, Your kindness fills my life

Your Love amazes me

[Chorus 1]
  A
I sing because You are good, and I dance because You are good
      D
And I shout because You are good, You are good, good to me

[Verse 2]
A                                  F#m E F#m D
Nothing and no one comes, anywhere close to You
                                  C#m   E    F#m
The earth and oceans deep, only reflect this truth
                                      E/G#      A
And in my darkest night, You shine as bright as day
                 E
Your love amazes me

[Chorus 2]
  A                                               E/G# A C#m
I sing because You are good, and I dance because You are good
      D                                                    E
And I shout because You are good, You are good, good to me

[Bridge]
       Bm7                    D                      A
With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim, You are good, You are good
       Bm7                 D                   A
In the sun or rain my life celebrates, You are good, You are good
