[Verse 1]
D            A                  Em          G
Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness,
D       A           G
Open my eyes, let me see
D           A         Em           G
Beauty that made this heart adore you,
D         A              G
Hope of a life spent with you


[Chorus]
                 D
And here I am to worship
                    A
Here I am to bow down
               D/F#                 G
Here I am to say that you're my God
                 D
You're altogether lovely,

Altogether worthy,
            D/F#          G
altogether wonderful to me


[Verse 2]
D            A          Em      G
King of all days, Oh so highly exalted
D            A     G
Glorious in Heaven above
D           A         Em          G
Humbly you came to the earth you created
D         A              G
All for love's sake became poor


[Bridge]
      A     D/F#     G
I'll never know how much it cost
     A     D/F#       G
to see my sin upon that cross
