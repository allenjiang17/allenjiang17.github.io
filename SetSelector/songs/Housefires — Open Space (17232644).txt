Pull me in closer

Close to Your heart

May I be a pure reflection Of all You are

Love that is patient
A
Love that is kind
D/F#                     G                        Em7
A love that keeps no offenses or wrongs in mind

My heart is an open space

For You to come and have Your way

You're faithful to find me
A
Right where I am
D/F#               G
Though even in my wandering You call me friend

Mercy receives me
A
And lifts me to my feet
D/F#                        G                 Em7
And I'm caught up in the wonder and mystery

[Pre-Chorus]
              D/F#
Of knowing Jesus
               G           A
Of knowing Jesus
