[Verse 1]
G             A
 I search for You

God of strength
G         A
 I bow to You
            Bm
In my brokenness

And no other king could have

So humbly come

To save my soul and heal

My heart

Bm       F#m7
 I have nothing more
D              A
 Than all You offer me
Bm         A
 There is nothing else
G          A        D
 That's of worth to me


[Chorus]
D     A        Bm
And I love You Lord
    G      D
You rescue me
        A          Bm
You are all that I want
       G
You're all I need

G          A
 I pray to You
        Bm  D/F#
God of peace
G          A
 I rest in You
           Bm    A
My cares released


[Bridge]
G                      D
In Your freedom I will live
                       Bm
In Your freedom I will live
           D/F#  G
I offer devotion
           D/F#  G
I offer devotion
