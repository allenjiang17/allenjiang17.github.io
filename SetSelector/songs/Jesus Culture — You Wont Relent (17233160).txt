[Verse 1]
C#m                       A
You won't relent until you have it all
E            F#m
My heart is yours
C#m                       A
You won't relent until you have it all
E            F#m
My heart is yours


[Verse 2]
 C#m               A              E
I'll set you as a seal, upon my heart
     F#m          C#m
as a seal upon my arm
                A               E
for there is a love, that is as strong as death
F#m                        C#m
jealousy demanding as the grave
          A       E                 F#m     C#m
and many waters, cannot quench this love


[Chorus]
C#m         A              E
Come be the fire inside of me,
            F#m            C#m
come be the flame upon my heart,
            A              E
Come be the fire inside of me,
      F#m           C#m
until You and I are one.

C#m                      A                           E
I don't wanna talk about you, like you're not in the room,
                   B
I wanna look right at you,
                       C#m
I wanna sing right to you.

I wanna sing right to you.
