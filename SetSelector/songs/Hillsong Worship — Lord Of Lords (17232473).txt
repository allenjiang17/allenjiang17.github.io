As is fit for the work of your hands

Now unto the Lamb

Who sits on the throne

Be glory and honour and praise
A                  E
All of creation resounds with the song

C#m        E          B           A
Spirit now living and dwelling within me
C#m          E           B
Keep my eyes fixed ever on Jesus' face
A             E             B          C#m
Let not the things of this world ever sway me
     A          B          E
I'll run 'til I finish the race

[Chorus 2]
    A
Now unto the Lamb
    E
Who sits on the throne

Be glory and honour and praise
A               E
All of eternity echoes the song

Worship and praise Him the Lord of Lords
