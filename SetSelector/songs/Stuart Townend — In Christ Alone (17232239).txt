[Verse 1]
 C       G       C       D
In Christ alone my hope is found,
G        C        D           G
He is my light my strength my song.
     C     G           C     D
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
G                C        D           G
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
                C          G         D
what heights of love, what depths of peace,
     G         C             G         D
when fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
   C     G      C      D
My Comforter my All in All,
G           C       D        G
here in the love of Christ I stand.


[Verse 2]
   C       G         C       D
In Christ alone, who took on flesh
G           C      D        G
fullness of God in helpless babe!
     C       G        C        D
This gift of love and righteousness,
G              C       D       G
scorned by the ones he came to save.
             C           G     D
till on that cross where Jesus died,
    G        C       G    D
the wrath of God was satisfied.
    C     G      C       D
for every sin on Him was laid;
G           C        D        G
here in the death of Christ I live.


[Verse 3]
      C      G          C    D
There in the ground His body lay,
G            C        D        G
Light of the world in darkness slain.
     C        G        C        D
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
G           C        D     G
up from the grave He rose again!
          C         G    D
And as He stands in victory,
     G         C         G       D
sins curse has lost it's grip on me.
    C    G       C     D
for I am His and He is mine,
G               C        D        G
bought with the precious blood of Christ.


[Verse 4]
   C        G        C       D
No guilt in life, no fear in death;
G           C        D         G
this is the pow'r of Christ in me.
     C            G      C     D
From life's first cry to final breath,
G        C        D    G
Jesus commands my destiny.
            C        G         D
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
    G    C        G        D
can ever pluck me from His hand,
     C     G       C        D
till He returns or calls me home;
G           C        D           G
here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand
