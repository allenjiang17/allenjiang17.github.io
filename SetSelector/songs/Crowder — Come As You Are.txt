[Verse 1]
A                         D               A
Come out of sadness, From wherever you've been
D           A            E      A
Come broken hearted, Let rescue begin
                      D              A
Come find your mercy, Oh sinner come kneel
D            A           E            F#m
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
D            A           E            A
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal


[Chorus]
                 D                      A
So Lay down your burdens, Lay down your shame
            D                    E
All who are broken, Lift up your face
            D                        F#m
Oh wanderer come home, You're not too far
                 D                   E
So lay down your hurt, Lay down your heart,
            F#m
Come as you are


[Verse 2]
A                              D                   A
There's hope for the hopeless, and all that who've strayed
D               A           E         A
Come sit at the table, Come taste the grace
                            D        A
There's rest for the weary, All that endures
D            A           E            A
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't cure


[Bridge]
            D
Come as you are
            F#m
Fall in his arms
            E
Come as you are


[Verse 3]
A                            D            A
There's joy for the morning, Oh sinner be still
D            A           E            F#m
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
D            A           E            A
Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal
