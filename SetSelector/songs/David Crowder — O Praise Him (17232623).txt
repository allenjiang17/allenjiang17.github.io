[Verse]
G                    D/F#
Turn your ear to heaven

And hear the noise inside

The sound of angels' awe

The sound of angels' songs

All to Christ the King

[Pre-chorus]
D                C2
How constant, how divine
D                C2
This song of ours will rise
D                   C2
O, how constant, how divine
D                C2
This love of ours will rise
D
Will rise

He is Holy, He is Holy

G                          D/F#
Turn your gaze to heaven
               C2
And raise a joyous noise
      G
The sound of salvation come
      D/F#
The sound of rescued ones
C2
All this for a king
Am7
Angels join to sing
C2
All for Christ our King

[Bridge]

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Em7         C2      Am7
He is holy, He is holy
