[Verse 1]
G           D/F#       C
Up to the highest of peaks
G          D/F#          C
Into the depths of the wildest sea
G             D/F#        C
There is no distance too wide
                 G   D/F#   C
That You won't reach

[Verse 2]
G            D/F#   C
Bigger than any regret
     G             D/F#        C
Your passion is stronger than even death
G               D/F#         C
Mountains may fall or give way
             Am                D
But Your mercy will not be swayed

[Chorus]
G              D
All I know is this
               Em                   C
Your love endures through every change
G            D
I am sure of it
               Em              C
Your love endures it will remain

[Verse 3]
    G          D          C
Whatever the season may bring
G            D          C
You have a harvest in store for me
G              D             C
Morning will break and I'll see
             Am               D
How faithfully You've been there

[Interlude]
G   D/F#   Em   C

[Bridge]
G      D/F#                 Em    C
Emmanuel Your every word sustaining
                   G/B    D
Your nearness is my victory
                     C
From summits and in valleys
C
I'll sing
