[Verse]
        G
There's beauty in my brokenness
         C
I've got true love instead of pain
        Em
There's freedom though You've captured me
         Am7
I've got joy instead of mourning

[Chorus]
                G
You give me joy
                     D
Down deep in my soul
                     C
Down deep in my soul
                     Am7
Down deep in my soul

[Bridge]
        G
In Your presence there is freedom
        D
In Your presence there is fullness
        C
In Your presence there is joy
Am7
Joy forevermore

[Outro]
G
Never been so free
D
Caught in Your love for me
C
Never been more secure
    Am7
Knowing Your heart Lord
