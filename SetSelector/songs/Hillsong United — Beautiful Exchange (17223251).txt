Tuning: E A D G B E


TEMPO: Slow

[Verse 1]
       Bm
You were near
              D/F#
Though I was distant
    G
Disillusioned I was
             D
Lost and insecure
             Bm
Still mercy fought
        D/F#
For my attention
           G
You were waiting at the door

Then I let you in

[Verse 2]
       Bm
Trading your life
              D/F#
For my offenses
    G
For my redemption
             D
You carried all the blame
             Bm
Breaking the curse
        D/F#
Of our condition
           G
Perfection took our place


[Chorus]
     Bm   D/F#       G      D
When only love could make a way
    Bm        D/F#       G
You gave your life in a beautiful exchange


[Verse 3]
       Bm
My burden erased
              D/F#
My life forgiven
    G
There is nothing
             D
that could take this love away
             Bm
And my only desire
        D/F#
and sole ambition
           G
Is to love you just the same

[Bridge]
A             G
  Holy are you God
Bm            D
  Holy is your name
A                     G
  With everything I’ve got
            Bm               D
  My heart will sing how I love you
