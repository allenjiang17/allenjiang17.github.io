[Verse 1]
C      G/B          Am       C
As the deer panteth for the water
       F            G     C
So my soul longeth after Thee
C    G/B           Am     C
You alone are my heart's desire
       F     G7      C    G/B
And I long to worship Thee.

[Chorus]
Am                F           C/E
You alone are my strength my shield
   Dm               F.     E
To You alone may my spirit yield
C    G/B           Am     C
You alone are my heart's desire
       F      G7      C
And I long to worship Thee

[Verse 2]
C      G/B           Am      C/G
I love you more than gold or silver
     F       G     C   G/C   F/C
Only You can satisfy
C    G/B          Am       C/G
You alone are the real joy giver
        F  Dm7 G7   C    G/B
And the apple of my eye

[Verse 3]

C         G/B            Am     C/G
You're my friend and you are my brother
     F          G     C   G/C   F/C
Even though you are a king
C      G/B           Am       C/G
I love you more than any other
        F    Dm7  G7 C    G/B
So much more than anything
