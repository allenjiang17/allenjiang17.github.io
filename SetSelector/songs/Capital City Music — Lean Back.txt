[Verse]
G         Bm         A
You will never leave
     G         Bm       A
Your love sustaining me
  G       Bm     A      D/F#
Before I even knew what love was
G        Bm        A
       G           Bm         A
You've brought me here to rest
    G          Bm           A
And given me space to breathe
    G          Bm       A    D/F#
So I'll stay still until it sinks in
G        Bm        A        D/F#

[Chorus]
        G        D             A
I will lean back in the loving arms
     Em  D/F#  G        Bm        A
Of a beautiful Father
G                 D               A
Breathe deep and know that He is good
        Em  D/F#     G        Bm        A
He's a love like no other

[Bridge]
           A               Bm
Now I can see Your love is better
              G                 D
Than all the others that I've seen
               A                Bm
I'm breathing deep all of Your goodness
             G             D
Your loving-kindness to me
