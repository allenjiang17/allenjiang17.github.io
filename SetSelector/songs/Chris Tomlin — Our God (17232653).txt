[Verse 1]
Em         C            G
Water You turned into wine
Em         C            G
Opened the eyes of the blind
                 Am
There's no one like You
           D
None like You
Em         C            G
Into the darkness You shine
Em         C            G
Out of the ashes we rise
                Am
There's no one like You
           D
None like You


[Chorus]
Em
Our God is greater
C
Our God is stronger
G                        D/F#
God You are higher than any other
Em
Our God is Healer
C
Awesome in Power
        G/B
Our God,
        D
Our God


[Verse 2]
Em         C            G
Into the darkness You shine
Em         C            G
Out of the ashes we rise
                 Am
There's no one like You
           D
None like You


[Bridge]
Em
And if our God is for us
C
Then who could ever stop us?
G
And if our God is with us
D/F#
Then what could stand against?
