[VERSE 1]
     Am                              F
You thought of us before the world began to breathe
     G                              C
You knew our names before we came to be
     Am                          F
You saw the very day we'd fall away from You
         G                      C
And how desperately we need to be redeemed


[PRE-CHORUS]
       F          G
Lord Jesus come lead us
        Dm       C        G
We're desperate for Your touch


[CHORUS]
C                        G
Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come
Dm    C         F                      G
That You would reign, that You would reign in us
C                            G
We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
Dm    C         F                      G
That You would reign, that You would reign in us


[VERSE 2]
  Am                            F
Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
      G                     C
Come search our hearts and purify our lives
    Am                                   F
We need Your perfect love, we need Your discipline
       G                         C
We're lost unless You guide us with Your light


[BRIDGE 1]
    G                F         C         G
We cry out for Your love to refine us, cry out
          F       C         G
For Your love to define us, cry out
          F        C       Am                 Gsus G
For Your mercy to keep us blameless until You return

[BRIDGE 2]

  F              C        G
So, reign please reign in us
                  F         C         G
Come purify our hearts, we need Your touch
                        F         C    G
Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
                           F         C       G
So the world may know You reign you reign in us
