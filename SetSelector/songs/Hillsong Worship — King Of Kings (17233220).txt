[Verse 1]
       C                 F
In the darkness, we were waiting
        G             C
Without hope, without light
          C                F
Till from heaven, You came running
          G             C
There was mercy in Your eyes
   C                  F
To fulfil the law and prophets
     G               C
To a virgin came the word
       C                 F
From a throne of endless glory
     G             C
To a cradle in the dirt


[Chorus]

Praise the Father
F
Praise the Son
Am7
Praise the Spirit
G
Three in one
C
God of glory
F
Majesty
Am7       F           G       C
Praise forever to the King of Kings


[Verse 2]
   C                  F
To reveal the kingdom coming
       G             C
And to reconcile the lost
   C                F
To redeem the whole creation
        G               C
You did not despise the cross
    C            F
For even in your suffering
        G            C
You saw to the other side
        C              F
Knowing this was our salvation
      G                C
Jesus for our sake you died


[Bridge]
        C                F
And the morning that You rose
       G               C
All of heaven held its breath
          C                   F
Till that stone was moved for good
        G                  C
For the Lamb had conquered death
        C                    F
And the dead rose from their tombs
        G               C
And the angels stood in awe
        C                  F
For the souls of all who'd come
       G          C
To the Father are restored
        C                    F
And the church of Christ was born
         G              C
Then the Spirit lit the flame
         C               F
Now this gospel truth of old
          G                C
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
       C                F
By His blood and in His name
       G            C
In His freedom I am free
        C             F
For the love of Jesus Christ
        G           C
Who has resurrected me
