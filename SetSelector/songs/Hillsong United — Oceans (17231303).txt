Em     D/F# G      D      C

[Verse 1]
Em                  D/F#    G
   You call me out upon the waters
           D                  C
The great unknown where feet may fail
Em                      D/F#   G
   And there I find you in the mystery
      D                   C
In oceans deep, my faith will stand

C            G          D
  And I will call upon Your name
C             G           D
  And keep my eyes above the waves
            C                 G             D
When oceans rise my soul will rest in Your embrace

For I am Yours and You are mine

   Your grace abounds in deepest waters

Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Em                         D/F#    G
   Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
          D                         C
You’ve never failed and You won’t start now

Let me walk upon the water wherever You would call me
Em                         C
   Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
