Bless the Lord, O my soul,

O my soul,
C             G    Dsus4 D
Worship His holy name.
          C        Em
Sing like never before,
C D  Em
O my soul.
     C              D        C/G  G
I'll worship Your holy name.

[Verse 1]
    C         G           D       Em
The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
C            G            D     Em
It's time to sing Your song again.
C            G              D           Em
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
C2         G                Dsus4 D  G   Gsus4 G
Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.

[Verse 2]
       C       G                D        Em
You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
      C       G               D         Em
Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
    C        G                D       Em
For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
C2           G              Dsus4 D  G    Gsus4 G
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

[Verse 3]
    C       G           D            Em
And on that day when my strength is failing,
    C         G            D         Em
The end draws near, and my time has come;
C        G                   D        Em
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
C2           G                 Dsus4  D  G  Gsus4 G
Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!
