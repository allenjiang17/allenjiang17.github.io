[Verse 1]
Am             C  F
Take this fainted heart
C                      G
Take these tainted hands
Am          C   F
Wash me in Your love
G           C    F
Come like grace again

[Chorus 1]
             Am           F
Even when my strength is lost
        C     G
I'll praise You
            Am       F
Even when I have no song
        C     G
I'll praise You
               Am       F        C
Even when it's hard to find the words
       G             F            F
Louder then I'll sing Your praise

Am       G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise
C        G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise
Am       G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise

[Verse 2]
Am             C    F
Take this mountain weight
C                 G
Take these ocean tears
Am               C   F
Hold me through the trial
G                F
Come like hope again

[Chorus 2]
              Am           F
Even when the fight seems lost
        C     G
I'll praise You
             Am          F
Even when it hurts like hell
        C     G
I'll praise You
             Am        F        C
Even when it makes no sense to sing
       G             F            F
Louder then I'll sing Your praise

Am       G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise
C        G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise
Am       G        F            F
  I will only sing Your praise

[Bridge]
        F     Am    G        F
And my heart burns only for You
        F             C     G
You are all, You are all I want
        F    Am    G        D5
And my soul waits only for You
            F             C           G
And I will sing 'til the morning has come

[Chorus 3]
               Am      F
Even when the morning comes
        C     G
I'll praise You
               Am       F
Even when the fight is won
        C     G
I'll praise You
             Am       F        C
Even when my time on earth is done
       G             F
Louder then I'll sing Your praise
I will only sing Your praise
