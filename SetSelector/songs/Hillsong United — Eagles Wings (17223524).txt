[Verse 1]

    Am         D         G             C
Here I am waiting, Abide in me I pray
    Am         D           G
Here I am longing for you
    Am          D          G               C
Hide me in your love, bring me to my knees
    Am          D              G
May I know Jesus more and more

[Chorus]
    G            C           Am
Come live in me, all my life
         D
Take over
    G               C              Am
Come breathe in me and I will rise
        D      G
On Eagles Wings
