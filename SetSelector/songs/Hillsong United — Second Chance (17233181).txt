[Verse 1]

   G
   You called my name, reached out Your hand
   C                               Am7
   Restored my life, and I was redeemed
                              D
   The moment You entered my life


[Verse 2]

   G
   Amazing grace, Christ gave that day
     C                                  Am7
   My life was changed when from my shoulders
                          D
   Fell the weight of my sin


[Chorus]

                              G
   So it’s with everything I am
                         D
   I reach out for Your hand
                  Em7
   The hope for change
                            C
   The second chance I’ve gained

                      G
   On You I throw my life
                          D
   Casting all my fears aside
                                Em7
   How could greater love than this
                   C
   Ever possibly exist


[Verse 3]

   G
   Consume my thoughts
                 C
   As I rest in You
                            Am7
   I’m now in love with a Saviour
      Am7                      C
   Bearing the marks of His love

[Pre-Bridge]

   Am7 -- D


[Bridge]
            G
   So I’ll wait upon You now
            D
   With my hands released to You
             Em7
   Where a little faith’s enough
             C
   To see mountains lift and move
             G
   And I’ll wait upon You now
        D
   Dedicated to Your will
            Em7
   To this love that will remain
       C
   A love that never fails
