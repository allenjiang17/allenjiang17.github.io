[Verse 1]
G                                         Em
This is my revelation, Christ Jesus crucified
G                                                       Em
Salvation through repentance, at the cross on which He died


[Verse 2]
G                                         Em
Now here my absolution, forgiveness for my sin
G                                                       Em
I sink beneath the waters, that Christ was buried in


[Chorus]
        C            G          D                  Em
I will rise, I will rise, as Christ was raised to life
        C           G      D
Now in Him, now in Him, I live


[Verse 3]
G                                         Em
I stand a new creation, baptized in blood and fire
G                                         Em
No fear of condemnation, by faith I'm justified


[Bridge]
C                       G
I rise as You are risen, declare Your rule and reign
D                            Em
My life confess Your lordship, and glorify Your name

C                       G
Your word it stands eternal, Your kingdom knows no end
D                            Em
Your praise goes on forever, and on and on again

C                       G
No power can stand against You, no curse assault Your throne
D                            Em
No one can steal Your glory, for it is Yours alone
C                           G
I stand to sing Your praises, I stand to testify
D
For I was dead in my sin
