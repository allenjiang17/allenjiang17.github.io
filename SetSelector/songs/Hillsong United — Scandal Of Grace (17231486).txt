[Verse 1]
C
Grace, what have you done?
Am            F         C
Murdered for me on that cross
  C
Accused in absence of wrong
  Am              F        C
My sin washed away in Your blood


[Pre-Chorus]

    Em           F           C
Too much to make sense of it all
  Em              F             C
I know that Your love breaks my fall
    G                     Am
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      F
So my soul will live


[Chorus]

         C
Oh to be like You
                         G
Give all I have just to know You
                        F
Jesus there's no one beside You
                       C     F  Am  F
Forever the hope in my heart


[Verse 2]

C
Death, where is your sting?
     Am           F         C
Your power is as dead as my sin
    C
The Cross has taught me to live
    Am        F                C
And mercy, my heart now to sing


[Pre-Chorus 2]

    Em          F                  C
The day and its troubles shall come
  Em              F               C
I know that Your strength is enough
    G                     Am
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      F
So my soul will live

[Bridge]

F        C
And it's all because of You, Jesus
     G
It's all because of You, Jesus
     Am
It's all because of Your love
        F
That my soul will live
