[Verse 1]
 E
You bought my life with the
                              A
Blood that you shed on the cross
When you died for the sins of men
                   B
And you let out a cry
                       E
Crucified now alive in me


[Verse 2]
E
These hands are yours
                               A
Teach them to serve as you please
And I'll reach out desperate to see
                    B
All the greatness of God
                           E
May my soul rest assured in you


[Pre-Chorus]
 A                 B
I'll never be the same
 A                 B
No I'll never be the same


[Chorus]
        E                  A
Cause I know that you're alive
        E                 A
You came to fix my broken life
        E            A
And I'll sing to glorify
        C#m           A
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ


[Verse]

 E
You changed it all
You broke down the wall
       A
When I spoke and confessed
In you I am blessed
       B
Now I walk in the light
                        E
In victorious sight of you


[Bridge]

 E               A
Your fire fall down
Your fire fall down
 C#m       A
On us we pray
As we seek


[Bridge]
 E             A
Show me your heart
             C#m
Show me your way
               A
Show me your glory
