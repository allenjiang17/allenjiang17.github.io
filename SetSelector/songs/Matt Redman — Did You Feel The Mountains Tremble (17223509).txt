TEMPO: Medium, Fast

[Verse 1]
C2
 Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Am7
 Did you hear the oceans roar
Dm7
 When the people rose to sing of
F2                 G7sus   C2   Gsus   C2   Gsus
 Jesus Christ, the ris-en One?

[Verse 2]
C2
 Did you feel the people tremble?
Am7
 Did you hear the singers roar?
Dm7
 When the lost began to sing of
F2                 G7sus    C2
 Jesus Christ, the sav-ing One?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
            F/A                      C
 And we can see that, God, You're mov-ing,
          F/A                 C
 A mighty river through the nations;
                F/A               C
 And young and old will turn to Je-sus.
Dm7
 Fling wide, you heavenly gates;
F2                      G7     C2   Gsus   C2
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord.

[Chorus]
 C                  F/A
 Open up the doors. Let the music play.
 Dm7                           C         G
 Let the streets resound with singing:
 C
 Songs that bring Your hope,
 F/A
 Songs that bring Your joy,
 Dm7                          C      G   (C2)
 Dancers who dance upon injustice.

[Verse 3]
C2
 Do you feel the darkness tremble?
Am7
 When all the saints join in one song,
Dm7
 And all the streams flow as one river
F2                G7sus    C2
 To wash away our broken-ness?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
             F/A                      C
 And here we see that, God, You're mov-ing;
           F/A           C
 A time of jubilee is coming,
                 F/A            C
 When young and old return to Je-sus.
Dm7
 Fling wide, you heavenly gates;
F2                      G7     C2   Gsus   C2
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord.
