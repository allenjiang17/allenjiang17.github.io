[Verse 1]
F
Come join the song, lift your voice
                        C
As heaven and earth give praise
F
Fall to your knees, at the feet
                          C
Of the Son of The One True God
F
Turn from old ways, lift your eyes
                         C
For the kingdom of God is here
F
Open your heart, offer all
                   C       G
For Jesus Christ is here, now


[Chorus]
        C
We have found our hope
        G
We have found our peace
        Am
We have found our rest
       F
In the One who loves
        C
He will light the way
        G
He will lead us home
      Am
As we offer all
       F
To the One who saves us


[Verse 2]
F
Call on the Name, that is hope
                C
Jesus the Son of God
F
Lord over all, He is good
                  C     G
And His mercy endures always


[Bridge]
    C
His love endures
            G
Forever His love endures
            Am
Forever His love endures
            F
Forever and ever
