[Verse 1]
D
God of creation
F#m                   E                    D     F#m   E
There at the start, before the beginning of time
     D
With no point of reference
    F#m                   E                        D      A/C#   E
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light

[Chorus]
             A
And as You speak
                  F#m              E
A hundred billion galaxies are born
                      A/C#              D
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
         F#m                D               A
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
                        F#m                    E
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
                        A/C#        D
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
      F#m                D               A   F#m  E   A/C#
If creation sings Your praises, so will I

[Verse 2]
D
God of Your promise
    F#m                     E                D     F#m    E
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
    D
For once You have spoken
    F#m                 E                       D      A/C#   E
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

[Chorus 2]
             A
And as You speak
                    F#m                       E
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
               A/C#            D
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
       F#m              D                A
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
                        F#m               E
I can see Your heart in everything You say
                     A/C#          D
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
      F#m          D                  A   F#m
If creation still obeys You, so will I
          E A/C#        D    F#m   E   D    F#m   E
(So will I,    so will I)

[Bridge]
         D                                  F#m   E
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
          D                                 F#m   E
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
        D                                   F#m   E
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
        D                             F#m           E
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
           D                                     F#m   E
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
       D                                  F#m   E
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
       D                                     F#m   E
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
           D                             F#m    E   D      F#m   E
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
D    F#m   E
Whoa

[Verse 3]
D
God of salvation
    F#m                          E                    D     F#m   E
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
     D
On a hill You created
    F#m                 E                      D     A/C#   E
The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

[Chorus 3]
             A
And as You speak
                  F#m               E
A hundred billion failures disappear
                            A/C#           D
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
        F#m             D                  A
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
                        F#m                   E
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
                         A/C#              D
Every part designed in a work of art called love
       F#m              D               A
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
                               F#m                   E
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
                      A/C#             D
Every precious one, a child You died to save
       F#m               D                   A
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

[Outro]
                       F#m            E
Like You would again a hundred billion times
                       A/C#              D
But what measure could amount to Your de - sire
           F#m           D                A
You're the One who never leaves the one behind
