Open our eyes

Break down our pride
    D                   Em

Our earthly crowns and all our desires

We lay at Your feet


[PRE-CHORUS]

Let hope rise

In Your holy light
G            D
  That every eye will see
C         Em  D
Jesus our God
          Am           C      D
Great and mighty to be praised

In the light of Your Name
