[Verse 1]
            G                    D/F#
There is an endless song echoes in my soul
  Em              C
I hear the music ring
               G                    D/F#
And though the storms may come I am holding on
Em     G      C
to the rock I cling

[Chorus]
G                              D
How can I keep from singing Your praise
           C          G/B        C              D
How can I ever say enough, how amazing is Your love
G                             D
How can I keep from shouting Your Name
             C            G/B          C         D            G
I know I am loved by the King, and it makes my heart want to sing

[Verse 2]
       G                   D/F#
I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
      Em             C
For I know my Savior lives
     D      G                           D/F#
And I will walk with You knowing You’ll see me through
    Em      G         C
And sing the songs You give

[Bridge]
       Am          G/B           C           D
I can sing in the troubled times sing when I win
       Am        G/B            C              D
I can sing when I lose my step and fall down again
       Am           G/B         C                 D
I can sing cause You pick me up sing cause You’re there
       Am           G/B                 C                 D
I can sing cause You hear me Lord when I call to You in prayer
      Am           G/B        C            D
I can sing with my last breath sing for I know
      Am                 G/B           C                 D
That I’ll sing with the angels and the saints around the throne
