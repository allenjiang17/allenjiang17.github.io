[Verse]
D     A            G            D
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
G            D      G                A
You became nothing, poured out to death
D      A          G              D
Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life
    G             A         D
And I'm in that place once again
G             A         D
I'm in that place once again

[Chorus]
    D            G             D                 A
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
     D              G             D          A
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Bm             G
Once again I thank You
Bm            A          D    G D A
Once again I pour out my life

[Verse]
D       A      G            D
Now You are exalted to the highest place
G       D                  G            A
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
D       A        G              D
But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace
    G             A         D
And I'm full of praise once again
G              A        D
I'm full of praise once again

Thank You for the cross
G                   A         D
Thank You for the cross, my Friend
