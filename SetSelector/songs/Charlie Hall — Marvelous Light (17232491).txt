[Verse 1]
A                    D
I once was fatherless,a stranger with no hope
A                       D
Your kindness wakened me,wakened me from my sleep
A                          D
Your love it beckons deeply,a call to come and die
A                             D
By grace now I will come and take this life,take Your life

[Pre-Chorus]
F#m      E               D
Sin has lost its power,death has lost its sting
F#m        E                D
From the grave You've risen victoriously

[Chorus]
A
Into marvelous light I'm running,
D
Out of darkness,out of shame
F#m               E
By the cross You are the truth
     D
You are the life,You are the way

[Verse 2]
A                            D
My dead heart now is beating,my deepest stains now clean
A                            D
Your breath fills up my lungs,now I'm free,now I'm free (repeat once if wanted)

[Bridge]
A                             D
Lift my hands and spin around,see the light that I have found
F#m    E               D
O the marvelous light,marvelous light
