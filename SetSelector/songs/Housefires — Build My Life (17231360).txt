[Verse 1]
G                  C
   Worthy of every song we could ever sing
G/B                    C
    Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
G                  C
   Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
            G/B           C
We live for you

[Verse 2]
G                 C
   Jesus a name above every other name
G                 C
   Jesus the only one that could ever save
G                  C
   Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
            G/B
We live for you
                C
Oh, we live for you (holy)

[Chorus]
C                    Am
Holy there is no one like you
                  G                  Em
There is none besides you, open up my eyes in wonder
      C                     Am
And show me who you are and fill me with your heart
    G                        Em
And lead me in your love to those around me

[Bridge]
   C               D                Em
And I will build my life, upon your love
        G/B
It is a firm foundation
C             D              Em
I will put my trust, in you alone
           G/B
And I will not be shaken
