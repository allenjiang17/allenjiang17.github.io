In a grace so relentless

Wrapped within arms of heaven

All fear removed, I breathe You in, I lean into

Your love, oh Your love

G                 Bm7
When I’m lost You pursue me
G                   Bm7
Lift my head to see Your glory
C                     D
Lord of all, so beautiful
G                   Bm7
Here in You, I find shelter
G                 Bm7
Captivated by the splendor
C                       D
of Your face, my secret place


[Bridge]

       G                         Am7
Your love so deep, it's washing over me
             Em                       C
Your face is all I seek, You are my everything
  G                       Am7
Jesus Christ, You are my one desire
              Em                    C
Lord hear my only cry, to know You all my life
