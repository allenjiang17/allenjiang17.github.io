E
I am chosen I am free

 A
Free now forever
E
You picked me up turned me around
                                C#m
You set my feet on solid ground
 A                E
Yours now forever


[Pre-Chorus]
A     C#m                     B
And nothing's gonna hold me back
                          A
Nothing's gonna hold me back
  C#m                      B
Nothing's gonna hold me back


[Chorus]
E                                 B
My chains fell off my heart was free
     C#m
I'm alive to live for You
      B
I'm alive to live for You
E                         B
Amazing Love, how can it be?
             C#m
You gave everything for me
              B
You gave everything for me
      A
Everything


[Verse 2]
E
You washed my sin and shame away
                                C#m
The slate is clean a brand new day
 A
Free now forever
E
Now boldly I approach Your throne
                                        C#m
To claim this crown through Christ my own
 A               E
Yours now forever

[Bridge]
     A             B
I'm free to live free to give
C#m
Free to be I'm free to love You
     A             B
I'm free to live free to give
