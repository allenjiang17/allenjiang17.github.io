TEMPO: Slow

Verse 1:
C/E               F                  C
   Who else would rocks cry out to worship
C/E            F                     C
   Whose glory taught the stars to shine
F             G              Am         G        F
   Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
F           G       C
   But this joy is mine

Chorus:
F                   C           G            Am
   With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
F               C                   G           Am
   You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
F            G                 C    Em   Am
   Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
  F             C/E          G        C
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more


Verse 2:
C/E               F              C
   Who else would die for our redemption
C/E            F                 C
   Whose resurrection means I'll rise
F              G              Am      G          F
   There isn't time enough to sing of all You've done
F              G         C
   But I have eternity to try

Bridge:

To the Lamb
       Fsus2 Fmaj7 G6 G
To the King  of    heaven

Praise for He rose
      C/E
Now He reigns
