[Verse 1]
      Amaj7                      E                B
If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear your voice
  Amaj7                            E              B
I hold onto what is true, though I cannot see
       Amaj7                             E               B
If the storms of life they come, and the road ahead gets steep
       Amaj7                         E               B
I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe


[Pre-Chorus]
   A               B               C#m
I remind myself of all that you’ve done
        A           B               A
And the life I have because of your son


[Chorus]
E
Love came down and rescued me
A
Love came down and set me free
C#m             B
I am yours
     A
I am forever yours
E
Mountain high or valley low
A
I sing out and remind my soul
C#m             B
I am yours
         A
I am forever yours


[Verse 2]
        Amaj7                                E                B
When my heart is filled with hope, and every promise comes my way
       Amaj7                          E       B
When I feel your hands of grace, rest upon me
        Amaj7                          E               B
Staying desperate for you God, Staying humbled at your feet
       Amaj7                          E                 B
I will lift these hands and praise, I will believe

[Bridge]
     E
I am yours
     A
I am yours
           C#m        B    A
For all my days Jesus I am yours
