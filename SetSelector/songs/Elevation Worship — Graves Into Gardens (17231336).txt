[Verse 1]
C/G            G
I searched the world
    C/G         G
But it couldn’t fill me
             Em
Man’s empty praise
                    D
and treasures that fade
              C
(are) never enough


[Verse 2]
               G
Then You came along
    C/G           G
And put me back together
            Em              D
And every desire is now satisfied
             C
Here in Your love


[Chorus]
           G
Oh there’s nothing better than You
        Em
There’s nothing better than You
             C
Lord there’s nothing
                       G
Nothing is better than You


[Verse 3]
C/G       G
I’m not afraid
   C/G         G
To show You my weakness
                Em
My failures and flaws
                      D
Lord You’ve seen them all
                      C
And You still call me friend


[Verse 4]
                      G
‘Cause the God of the mountain
      C/G        G
Is the God of the valley
              Em
There’s not a place
               D
Your mercy and grace
               C
Won’t find me again

[Bridge]
G                               C  G
  You turn mourning to dancing
                          C  G
You give beauty for ashes
                          C
You turn shame into glory
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can
 G                              C  G
  You turn graves into gardens
                           C  G
You turn bones into armies
                            C
You turn seas into highways
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can
