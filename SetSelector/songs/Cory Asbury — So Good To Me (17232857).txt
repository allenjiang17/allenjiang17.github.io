[Verse 1]
C     G/B          Am7     G
  I waited patiently upon the Lord
C          G/B                 Am7
  And He inclined and heard my cry
C           G/B             Am7  G
  He pulled me up out of the miry clay
C         G/B         Am7
  He set my feet upon a rock


[Verse 2]
          C           G/B
He gave me, beauty for ashes
    Am7        G
And joy for my mourning
    C       G/B       Am7
And praise for heaviness
         C              G/B
He put a new song in my mouth
     Am7            G
And a crown upon my head
           C       G/B   Am7
He gave me life forevermore


[Main Chorus]
        C         G/B
Hes been so good, so so good to me
Am7       G                C         G/B             Am7
So good, so so good to me, so good so so good to me Jesus


[Chorus 2]
         C                   G/B
Cause He picked me up and He turned me around
       Am7                   G
And He placed my feet on the solid ground
     C   G/B     Am7
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


[Chorus 3]
      C        G/B           Am7              G
I got love joy peace and righteousness in the Holy Spirit
C  G/B               Am7
      Wo, oh, oh, oh oh yeah
