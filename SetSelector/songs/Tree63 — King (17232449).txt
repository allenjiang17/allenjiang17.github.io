[Verse 1]
C
We have heard the thunder, and
Am7
We have seen the storm
Gsus
Echoes of your kingdom coming
F2
Rumors of our home
      C/E                   F2
Where one day we will stand before you Lord
Gsus  Dm7            C/E         F2
Our   altogether beautiful reward

[Chorus:]
            C        G/B    F/A       Gsus
And we will give you glory, bring you honour
F2                  C/E  Dm7                  F2
King above all kings,    you deserve our everything
        C        G/B    F/A       G/A
We will lift our voices with your praises
F         G       C
Jesus you are our King

[Verse 2]
       C
Though now we walk in darkness
       Am7
Though now we see in part
      Gsus
Right now we're warmed by the burning flames
       F2
Of the fire in our hearts
       C/E                    F2
You've promised you will lead us to your throne
Gsus  Dm7                 C/E           F2
Where we will worship you and you alone


[Bridge:]
C
We will give You glory
Am7
We will give You glory
Gsus
We will give You glory
F2
We will give You glory
