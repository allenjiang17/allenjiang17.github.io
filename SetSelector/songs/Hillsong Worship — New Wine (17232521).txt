[Verse 1]
D
  In the crushing
Gadd9
  In the pressing
Bm               Gadd9    D
  You are making New Wine

[Verse 2]
D
  In the soil I
Gadd9
Now surrender
Bm               Gadd9   D
You are breaking New Ground

[Pre-Chorus]
     Gadd9           Bm            A       D/F#
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
     Gadd9           Bm            A
When I trust You I don't need to understand

[Chorus]
D
Make me Your vessel
Gadd9
Make me an offering
Bm
Make me whatever
    Gadd9      D
You want me to be
D
I came here with nothing
Gadd9
But all You have given me
Bm
Jesus bring New Wine
Gadd9     D
Out of me

[Bridge]
Gadd9
Where there is New Wine
         Bm       A    D/F#
There is new power
Gadd9
There is new freedom
       Bm          D
The Kingdom is here
Gadd9
I lay down my old flames
              Bm      A
To carry Your new fire
Gadd9
Today
