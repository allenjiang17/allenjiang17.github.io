[VERSE 1]
        D
On that day when I see
         G            D
All that You have for me
        Bm
When I see You face to face
      F#m                A
There surrounded by Your grace
       D
All my fears swept away
       G             D
In the light of Your embrace
           Bm
Where Your love is all I need
    F#m          A
And forever I am free


[PRE-CHORUS 1]
          Em
Where the streets are made of gold
        D/F#
In Your presence healed and whole
        G
Let the songs of heaven rise to You alone


[CHORUS]
D              G          Bm
    No weeping no hurt or pain
                 G
No suffering You hold me now You hold me now
D                  G       Bm
    No darkness no sick or lame
              G
No hiding You hold me now You hold me now


[VERSE 2]
        D
In this life I will stand
         G            D
Through my joy and my pain
        Bm
Knowing there's a greater day
      F#m                A
There's a hope that never fails
       D
Where Your Name is lifted high
      G             D
And forever praises rise
           Bm
For the glory of Your Name
    F#m          A
I'm believing for the day


[PRE-CHORUS 2]
          Em
Where the wars and violence cease
        D/F#
All creation lives in peace
       G
Let the songs of heaven rise to You alone


[BRIDGE]
D
  For eternity
A
  All my heart will give
Em                      G
  All the glory to Your Name
