[Verse 1]

C                                F
Praise You when I’m overwhelmed, Praise You in my brokenness
C                                F
Praise You so I don’t forget Who You are Who You are
C                                F
Praise You when I’ve lost my way, Praise You when I’m so afraid
C                                      F
Praise You 'cause it doesn't change Who You are Who You are


[Chorus 1]
C                          F
Weeping may endure for the night
                     C                         F
But joy comes in the morning, Joy comes in the morning
Am                         F
Weeping may endure for the night
                     C                         F
But joy comes in the morning, Joy comes in the morning

[Verse 2]

C                                F
Praise You when I’m empty-handed, Praise You when I feel abandoned
C                                 F
Praise You cause I’m not alone You see me You see me
C                               F
Praise You when the road is long, Praise You when my faith is gone
C                                      F
Praise You 'cause You hear the song I’m singing I’m singing


[Bridge]

               Am                   F
I will fear no evil, I know You are with me
                        C                            G
Closer than I think You are, Closer than I think You are
                Am                      F
Fighting all my battles, Lighting every shadow
                        C                            G
Closer than I think You are, Closer than I think You are
