[Verse 1]
Am           G           F       C
This is my prayer in the desert
     Am             G           F    C
When all that’s within me feels dry
Am         G            F          C
This is my prayer in my hunger and need
   Am         G       F
My God is the God who provides


[Verse 2]

Am         G             F    C
This is my prayer in the fire
   Am          G         F    C
In weakness or trial or pain
Am         G               F               C
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
    Am       C/E              F
So refine me Lord through the flame


[Chorus]
                 C                    G
And I will bring praise, I will bring praise
          F                       C
No weapon formed against me shall remain
G/B      G               Am
I will rejoice, I will declare
          F           G     Am
God is my victory and He is here

[Verse 3]

Am         G             F      C
This is my prayer in the battle
     Am         G            F    C
When triumph is still on its way
Am     G             F            C
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
   Am          G            F
So firm on His promise I'll stand

All of my life, In every season
Am
You are still God
                   G
I have a reason to sing
F                  C
I have a reason to worship

[Verse 4]

Am         G              F      C
This is my prayer in the harvest
     Am        G          F      C
When favor and providence flow
Am         G            F        C
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
    Am           G            F
The seed I've received I will sow
