[Verse 1]
     G          C
You go before I know
                 G              C
That You've even gone to win my war
                       Em            D
You come back with the head of my enemy
                      Em            D
You come back and You call it my victory

[Verse 2]
     G           C
You go before I know
                 G              C
That You've even gone to win my war
                     Em         D
Your love becomes my greatest defence
                     Em         D
It leads me from the dry wilderness

[Pre-Chorus]
              G/B          C
All I did was praise
              G/D           C
All I did was worship
              G/B            C
All I did was bow down
              G/D            C
All I did was stay still

[Chorus]
D    Em     C
Hallelujah, You have saved me
D        Em          C
 So much better Your way
D    Em             C
Hallelujah, great Defender
D        Em          C
 So much better Your way

[Verse 3]
    G              G/B
You know before I do
                   G                 G/B
Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
                  Em                 D
Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
               Em                D
You restore my faith and hope again

[Bridge]
                  G/B
When I thought I lost me
                  C
You knew where I left me
           Bm              C
You reintroduced me to Your love
                      G/B
You picked up all my pieces
               C
Put me back together
               Bm          C
You are the defender of my heart
