[Verse]
G            Gsus4     G                   Gsus4        G
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
G                  Gsus4  G                      Gsus4   G
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
    C       G/B                          Am7        D
You tell me that You're pleased and that I'm never alone

[Chorus]
                    C
You're a good, good father
               G/B                     Am7            D
It's who You are, it's who You are, it's who You are
                    C
And I'm loved by you
          G/B               Am7            D
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

[Verse]
G         Gsus4 G                     Gsus4  G
I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
G           Gsus4    G                      Gsus4    G
But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide
           C          G/B                Am7        D
Because You know just what we need before we say a word

[Bridge]
C                              Em
You are perfect in all of your ways
Am7                            G
You are perfect in all of your ways
C                              Em       D
You are perfect in all of your ways to us [2x]

[Verse]
G       Gsus4  G         Gsus4  G
Love so undeniable I can hardly speak
G         Gsus4  G           Gsus4  G
Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think
           C        G/B
As You call me deeper still
           Am7     G/B
As You call me deeper still
           C        G/B
As You call me deeper still
      Am7      D
Into love love love
