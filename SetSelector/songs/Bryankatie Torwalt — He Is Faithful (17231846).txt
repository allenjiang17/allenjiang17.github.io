[Verse]

E
I have heard a sound
A
Coming on the wind
E
Changing hearts and minds
A
Healing brokenness
C#m
I feel a generation
A
Breaking through despair
C#m
I hear a generation
A
Full of faith declare


[Pre-Chorus]
B       C#m           A
and our song, it will be
B             C#m            A
out of the darkness, we will rise and sing


[Chorus]

E               A
He is faithful, he is glorious and
C#m             A
He is Jesus, and all my hope is in Him
E               A                       C#m                 A
He is freedom, he is healing right now, he is hope and joy, love and peace and life


[Verse]
E
I have seen a light
A
Like the break of dawn
E
Giving blind men sight
A
Letting lame men walk
C#m
I see a generation
A
with resurrection life
C#m
We are a generation
A
filled with the power of Christ


[Bridge]

C#m     A                E       B
He has paid the highest price
C#m     A                E       B
He has proven his great love for us
C#m     A                E       B
We will praise him with our lives
C#m     A                E       (B)  last ending chord: E
And proclaim our love for him
