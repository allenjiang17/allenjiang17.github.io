[Verse]
Em                   G/B
When I'm dry and thirsty Lord
        C               G
And I'm crying out for more
 Em          G/B            C
I know I can trust in Your love
        Em              G/B
In the darkness in the night
          C                G
When I'm starving for the light
Em            G/B           C
I know I can trust in Your love

[Pre-Chorus]
Am           G/B          C
You keep no record of my sin
Am           G/B            D
You don't remember all my shame

[Chorus]
C
Your love heals every disease
G/B
Your love fulfills my every need
Em
Your love is everything to me
D/F#
Your love is everything

[Bridge]
               C
I will not forget
                      D
I won't forget Your promises
              Em
I will not forget
                     D/F#
I won't forget Your love
