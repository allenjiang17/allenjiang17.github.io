[Verse 1]
   Am        F              C
My life is a light for Your cause
   Am         F             C
My will laid aside for Your call
      Dm             Am           F
And reserved are the depths of my heart
         C
Only for You


[Verse 2]
    Am            F          C
I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
     Am       F         C
They overcome all of my ways
   Dm           Am         F
Realigning each step every day
                 C
To live for Your glory


[Chorus 1]
            G      Am        F
And there's none beside You, God
            G      Am        F
And there's none beside You, God


[Verse 3]
       Am           F           C
You're there in the dark of the night
      Am          F           C
While holding the sun and its light
            Dm          Am        F
Through the triumph and trials of life
                 C
There's no one beside You


[Verse 4]
     Am               F              C
Your voice called the stars by their name
          Am             F            C
Cause You whispered them all to their place
        Dm         Am         F
To testify of Your wonder and grace
                C
Both now and forever


[Chorus 2]
            G      Am        F
And there's none beside You, God
        G      Am        F
There's none beside You, God
          G       Am         F
I live my life to shine Your light
               G      Am        F
Cause there is none beside You, God

[Bridge]
C
No eye has seen

No ear has heard
    F
The depths of Your love, Lord
Am
No mind can fathom

The love You deserve
    F
How great You are!
