[Verse 1]
G          F
A thousand times I’ve failed
             C          G
Still Your mercy remains
             F
And should I stumble again
          C          G
I’m caught in Your grace

[Chorus 1]
     Am
Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
        Am
Never ending
     F             C        G  F  C  G  F  C
Your glory goes beyond all fame


[Verse 2]
G           F
Your will above all else
      C       G
My purpose remains
           F
The art of losing myself
       C          G
In bringing You praise

[Pre-Chorus]
F                   C
In my heart and my soul
                 Am
Lord I give You control
                     G
Consume me from the inside out
      F              Am
Lord let justice and praise
            G
Become my embrace
                     Dm
To love You from the inside out


[Chorus 2]
     Am
Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
      Am
Never ending
     F             C        G
Your glory goes beyond all fame
           C           F
And the cry of my heart
           G      Am
Is to bring You praise
          F      G
From the inside out
            F      G
Lord my soul cries out
