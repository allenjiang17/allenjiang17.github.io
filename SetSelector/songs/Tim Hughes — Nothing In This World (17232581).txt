Tuning: E A D G B E


TEMPO: Slow

[Verse 1]
E
Nothing in this world
     B
No treasure man could buy
      C#m                  A             B
Could take the place of drawing near to You
           E
There’s nothing I want more
            B
Than to spend my days with You
C#m                 A                 B
Dwelling in Your secret place of praise

[Chorus]
    E   B     C#m  A
And oh, how I need You
E  B      C#m A
Jesus, I need You
            A       B     C#m
You are the One who satisfies
            A        B     E
You are the One who satisfies

[Verse 2]
     E
So place within my heart
   B
A fire that burns for You
     C#m           A                 B
That waters cannot quench nor wash away
     E
And let that fire blaze
B
Through all eternity
      C#m             A               B
Where one day I shall see You face to face
