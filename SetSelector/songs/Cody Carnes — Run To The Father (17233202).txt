[Verse 1]
C                Dm7
 I've carried a burden
Am7                F2
 for too long on my own
C            Dm7
 I wasn't created
Am7           F2
 to bear it alone
C               Dm7
 I hear Your invitation
Am7             F2
 to let it all go
           C                  Dm7
 I see it now, I'm laying it down
                Am7 G   F2
 And I know that I need You


[Chorus 1]
              C                    Dm7
 I run to the Father, I fall into grace
                    Am7                 F2
 I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
                   C                        Dm7
 My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
                     Am7              F2
 So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

[Verse 2]
C              Dm7
 You saw my condition,
Am7                   F2
 had a plan from the start
C                 Dm7
 Your Son for redemption,
Am7                F2
 the price for my heart
C                   Dm7
 And I don't have a context
Am7                F2
 for that kind of love
               C                  Dm7
 I don't understand, I can't comprehend
              Am7 G   F2
 All I know is I need You

[Bridge]
                    Am7     F2
 My heart has been in Your sights
             C/E       G
 Long before my first breath
            Am7    F2
 Running into Your arms
                C/E      G
 Is running to life from death
                  Am7            F2
 And I feel this rush deep in my chest
                 C/E   G
 Your mercy is calling out
           Am7            F2
 Just as I am You pull me in
               C/E     G
 And I know I need You now
