[Verse 1]

F
May my prayer like incense rise before You
  Dm
The lifting of my hands a sacrifice
Bb
oh Lord Jesus turn Your eyes upon me
    Gm                        C
For I know there is mercy in Your sight

     F
Your statutes are my heritage forever
    Dm
My heart is set on keeping Your decrees
       Bb
Please still my anxious urge toward rebellion
    Gm                          C
Let love keep my will upon its knees


[Chorus]

   F               C
Oh God You are my God
    Bb                 Gm
And I will ever praise You
   F               C
Oh God You are my God
    Bb                 Gm
And I will ever praise You


[Verse 2]

   F
To all creation I can see a limit
    Dm
But Your commands are boundless and have none
   Bb
So Your word is my joy and meditation
         Gm                         C
From the rising to the setting of the sun

F
All Your ways are loving and are faithful
     Dm
Your road is narrow but Your burden light
Bb
Because You gladly lean to lead the humble
         Gm                       C
I shall gladly kneel to leave my pride

[Bridge]

F                        C
I will seek You in the morning
         Bb                   Gm
I will learn to walk in Your ways
     F                   C
And step by step You’ll lead me
           Bb                   F
And I will follow You all of my days
