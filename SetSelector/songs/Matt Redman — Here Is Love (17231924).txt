Verse 1:
         F                 Bb
Here is love, vast as the ocean
        F               C
Loving kindness as the flood
           F                  Bb
When the prince of life, our ransom
         F        C       F
Shed for us his precious blood


Chorus:

         F             C
Who his love will not remem-ber
         Gm                 F
Who can cease to sing his praise?
         Dm         Bb
He will never be forgotten

Throughout heavens eternal days


Verse 2:
        F          Bb
On the mount of crucifixion
             F             C
Fountains opened deep and wide
              F                 Bb
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
          F         C       F
Flowed a vast and gracious tide


Chorus 2:
           F                C
Grace and love like mighty rivers
           Gm           F
Poured incessant from above
             Dm               Bb
And heavens peace and perfect justice
           F          C   F
Kissed a guilty world in love

Bridge:
       F
No love is higher
       Bb
No love is deeper
        F                C
No love is like your love Oh Lord
