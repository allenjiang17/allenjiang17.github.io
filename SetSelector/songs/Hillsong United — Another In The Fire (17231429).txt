[Verse 1]
Am                      F               C
There’s a grace when the heart is under fire
Am                   F                 C
Another way when the walls are closing in
Am                     F
And when I look at the space between
C                         G/C
Where I use to be and this reckoning
Am            F        C
I know I will never be alone


[Chorus 1]
                         Am
There was another in the fire
F                C
Standing next to me
                         Am
There was another in the waters
F                C
Holding back the seas
                       Am
And should I ever need reminding
F                    C
Of how I've been set free
                                Am
There is a cross that bears the burden
      F                C
Where another died for me


[Tag]
                        Am   F   C   Am   F   C
There is another in the fire


[Verse 2]
Am                   F                C
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
Am              F               C
I’m no longer a slave to my sin anymore
Am                       F
And should I fall in the space between
C                          Em7
What remains of me and this reckoning
Am                 F                    C
Either way I won’t bow to the things of this world
Am                F        C
And I know I will never be alone


[Chorus 2]
                        Am
There is another in the fire
F                C
Standing next to me
                        Am
There is another in the waters
F                C
Holding back the seas
                       Am
And should I ever need reminding
F                    C
What power set me free
                               Am
There is a grave that holds no body
             F              C
And now that power lives in me


[Bridge]
              Am           F
I can see the light in the darkness
       C                G
As the darkness bows to him
               Am          F
I can hear the roar in the heavens
       C                   G
As the space between wears thin
               Am                   F
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
       C                 G
As the prison walls cave in
               Dm
Nothing stands between us
               F       G   Am   F   C   Am   F   C
Nothing stands between us


[Verse 3]
Am                F
There is no other name
                  C
But the name that is Jesus
Am                   F
He who was and still is
                    C
And will be through it all
Am                      F
So come what may in the space between
        C
All the things unseen
         G/C
And this reckoning
Am            F        C
I know I will never be alone
Am            F        C
I know I will never be alone


[Chorus 3]
                           Am
There'll be another in the fire
F                C
Standing next to me
                           Am
There'll be another in the waters
F                C
Holding back the seas
                       Am
And should I ever need reminding
F                       C
How good You've been to me
                              Am
I'll count the joy come every battle
        F                        C
Cause I know that's where You'll be

[Outro]
                              Am
I'll count the joy come every battle
F                                C
Cause I know that's where You'll be
