TEMPO: Slow

[Verse 1]

Bm       A              G
Savior I come, quiet my soul
     D A Bm           A
Remember redemption's hill
                     G
where Your blood was spilled
       D     A
for my ransom


[Pre-Chorus]
Em           A
Everything I once held dear
   Bm      A      G
I count it all as lost


[Chorus]
               G
Lead me to the cross
           D           A
where Your love poured out
               G
Bring me to my knees
        D      A
Lord, I lay me down
             G
Rid me of myself
    D       A
I belong to You
       Em
Lead me
 G      A      Bm
Lead me to the cross

[Verse 2]

Bm          A                  G
You were as I, tempted and tried
D  A       Bm              A
Human, the word became flesh
                G
Bore my sin and death
D          A
Now You're risen


[Bridge]
        D    G  A
To your heart
        D    G  A
To your heart
                D    G  A
Lead me to your heart
                D    G  A
Lead me to your heart
