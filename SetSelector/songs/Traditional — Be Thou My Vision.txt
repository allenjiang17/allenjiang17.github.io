[Verse 1]
D          Bm        G          D
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
A                         G              A
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Bm          G            D         G A
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
D         Bm            G           D
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.


[Verse 2]
D          Bm          G            D
Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
A                      G            A
I ever with Thee, and Thou with me, Lord
Bm            G           D          G A
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
D          Bm            G           D
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.


[Verse 3]
D          Bm             G              D
Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
A                   G       A
Be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight
Bm             G        D            G  A
Thou my soul’s shelter, Thou my high tow’r:
D             Bm            G           D
Raise Thou me heav’nward, O pow’r of my pow’r.


[Verse 4]
D        Bm            G           D
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
A                     G          A
Thou mine inheritance now and always:
Bm            G     D           G  A
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
D            Bm         G             D
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.


[Verse 5]
D            Bm         G       D
High King of heaven, my vict’ry won,
A           Bm             G                 A
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Bm          G              D    G A
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
D           Bm        G       D
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
D           Bm        G       D
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
