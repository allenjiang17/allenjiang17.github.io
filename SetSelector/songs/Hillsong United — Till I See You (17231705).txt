[Verse 1]
              A           B               C#m7
The greatest love that anyone could ever know
          A                  B                C#m7
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
            A               B
And 'til I see You face to face
           C#m7
And grace amazing takes me home

I'll trust in You

With all I am I live to see Your Kingdom come
           A                  B                C#m7
And in my heart I pray you'd let Your will be done
            A               B
And 'til I see You face to face
           C#m7
And grace amazing takes me home
            A
I'll trust in You

I will live to love You
        C#m7   E/G#
I will live to bring You praise
        A      B              C#m7 B
I will live a child in awe of You

[Verse 3]
             A                     B          C#m7
You are the voice that called the universe to be
             A             B                   C#m7
You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me
           A                B
And 'til I see You face to face
           C#m7
And grace amazing takes me home
            A
I'll trust in You

And with all I am my soul will bless
      A
