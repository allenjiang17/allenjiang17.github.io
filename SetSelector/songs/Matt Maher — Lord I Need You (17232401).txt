[Verse 1]
        G     C    G
Lord, I come, I confess
       Em7    D       Cadd9
Bowing here I find my rest
        G     C     G
Without You I fall apart
           G/D D                C
You're the One   that guides my heart


[Chorus]
        G         C     G    D/F#
Lord, I need You, Oh, I need You
Em    C      G    D
Every hour I need You
   G/B   C         G/D      C
My one defense, my righteousness
   G/D        D    G    C
Oh God, how I need You

Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
               Em7      D         Cadd9
Where grace is found is where You are
              G          C     G
And where You are, Lord, I am free
    Dsus D             G
Holiness  is Christ in me


[Bridge]

C        G/B     D       Em
Teach my song to rise to You
C               G/B      C
When temptation comes my way
           C      G/B        D       Em
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
C                D        G    C
Jesus, You're my hope and stay


[Chorus]

        G         C     G    D/F#
Lord, I need You, Oh, I need You
Em    C      G    D
Every hour I need You
   G/B   C         G/D      C
My one defense, my righteousness
   G/D        D    G    C
Oh God, how I need You
