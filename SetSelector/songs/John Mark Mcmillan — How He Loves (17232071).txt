TEMPO: Slow

[Verse]
C
He is jealous for me,
Am7
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
G                                          Fmaj7
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
C
When all of a sudden,
                      Am7
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
      G
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
        Fmaj7
And how great Your affections are for me.


[Pre-Chorus]
    C                   Am7
And oh, how He loves us oh
          G
Oh how He loves us,
                Fmaj7
How He loves us all

[Chorus]
   C
He loves us,
          Am7
Oh how He loves us,
          G
Oh how He loves us,
          Fmaj7
Oh how He loves.


[Verse 2]
C
We are His portion and He is our prize,
Am7
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
G                               Fmaj7
If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking.
C
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
Am7
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
G
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
Fmaj7
When I think about, the way…
