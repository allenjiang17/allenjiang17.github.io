[Verse 1]
G              D
When the music fades
                    Am
And all is stripped away
             D
And I simply come,
G               D
Longing just to bring,
                     Am
Somethings that's of worth,
                     D
That would bless your heart.

[Bridge]
Am             G           D
I'll bring you more that a song

For a song in itself
Am                G       D
Is not what you have required
Am              G      D
You search much deeper within

Than the way things appear
Am             G       D
You're looking into my heart.

[Chorus]
G                      D
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
         Am
When it's all about you,
     C         D
It's all about you Jesus
G                       D
I'm sorry Lord, for the thing I've made it
          Am
When it's all about you
C         D
All about you Jesus

[Verse 2]
G               D
King of endless worth
             Am
no one could express
             D
How much you deserve
G                   D
Though I'm weak and poor,
              Am
All I have is yours
              D
Every single breath
