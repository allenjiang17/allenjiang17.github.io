David Crowder Band — Wholly Yours


Tuning: E A D G B E


[Verse]
A    A/C#         D                      A
I am full of earth You are heaven’s worth
     A/C#             D
I am stained with dirt prone to depravity
A       A/C#      D                        A
You are everything that is bright and clean
        A/C#     D
The antonym of me You are divinity

[Pre-Chorus]
A/C#   D               A         E/G#
But a certain sign of grace is this
A/C#     D         A        E/G#
From a broken earth flowers come up
D
Pushing through the dirt

[Chorus]

         D     A     E/G#    E             D    A    E
You are holy, holy, holy all heaven cries holy holy God
         D     A     E/G#  E         D    A        E
You are holy, holy, holy I wanna be holy like You are

[Verse 2]
A        A/C#          D                   A
You are everything that is bright and clean
         A/C#            D
And You’re covering me with Your majesty

A/C#    D               A          E/G#
And the truest sign of grace was this
A/C#      D              A           E/G#
From wounded hands redemption fell down
D
Liberating man

[Bridge]
G                   D                          A/C#
But the harder I try the more clearly can I feel
                   E/G#                       D
The depth of our fall and the weight of it all
                        A/C#                   A
And so this might could be the most impossible thing
                   E/G#          D
Your grandness in me making me clean

[Chorus 2]:
  A    E/G#        D     A      E/G#
Glory hallelujah glory glory, hallelujah
   D         A         E/G#     E           D      A      E
So here I am all of me finally everything wholly wholly wholly
       D      A      E/G#         D      A      E     A
I am wholly wholly wholly  I am wholly wholly wholly Yours
