G     D/F#         Em       G/B     C               G  D
Jesus what a    Saviour, what a Brother, what a Friend

[Pre-Chorus]
     Am            G/B    C                 G   D
Your heart, it knows no borders, knows no walls
       Am        G/B    C                    G    D
You're constantly   moving towards me with open arms

I've never known a love like Yours
                   G                D
I've never known a love like Yours no
                   Am              G/B    C
I've never known a love like Yours
                   G               D
I've never known a love like Yours


[Bridge]
Am     G    C           G                D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, what a beautiful way You've shown us
Am     G    C           G                D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, what a wonderful Saviour
