[Verse 1]
C
  Walking around these walls
G
  I thought by now they'd fall
C                              G
  But you have never failed me yet
C
  Waiting for change to come
G
  Knowing the battle's won
C                              G
  For you have never failed me yet

[Chorus]

C                    D
  Your promise still stands
                G             C
Great is your faithfulness, faithfulness
C                   D
  I'm still in your hands
             G                 C
This is my confidence, you've never failed me yet

[Verse 2]
C
  I know the night won't last
G
  Your word will come to pass
C                                 G
  My heart will sing your praise again
C
  Jesus You're still enough
G
  Keep me within your love
C                                 G
  My heart will sing your praise again


[Bridge]

G/B    C                 G/B    C                D      G
      I've seen you move,    you move the mountains
            D/F#     G                        C
And I believe,     I'll see you do it again
              G/B    C                D      G
You made a way      when there was no way
            D/F#     G                      C
And I believe,     I'll see you do it again
