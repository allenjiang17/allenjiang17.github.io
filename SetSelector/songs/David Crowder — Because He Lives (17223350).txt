[Verse 1]
G                                  C
God sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;
           G              D
He came to love, heal and forgive;
             G              C
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
         G                 D               G
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

[Chorus]
G                            C
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           G                  D
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
          G C G             C
Because I know He holds the future,
            G
And life is worth the living,
D               G
Just because He lives!
