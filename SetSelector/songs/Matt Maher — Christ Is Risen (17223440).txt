[Verse 1]
E
Let no one caught in sin remain
  A                 B
Inside the lie of inward shame
E
But fix our eyes upon the cross
      A            C#m          B
And run to Him who showed great love
      E  A   B
And bled for us

Freely You’ve bled for us


[Chorus]
          E
Christ is risen from the dead

Trampling over death by death
      A
Come awake, come awake
         C#m              B
Come and rise up from the grave
         E
Christ is risen from the dead

We are one with Him again
                  A
Come awake, come awake
      C#m                 B
Come and rise up from the grave


[Verse 2]
E
Beneath the weight of all our sin
A
You bowed to none but heaven’s will
E
No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
      A            C#m          B
No burden great can hold You down
   E         A      B
In strength You reign

Forever let Your church proclaim


[Bridge]

E  A     C#m            B
O death, where is your sting?
E  A     C#m            B
O hell, where is your victory?
E  A             C#m            B
O church, come stand in the light
E             A     C#m            B
The glory of God has defeated the night
E  A     C#m            B
O death, where is your sting?
E  A     C#m            B
O hell, where is your victory?
E  A             C#m            B
O church, come stand in the light
E  A
Our God is not dead
C#m            B
He's alive! He's alive!
