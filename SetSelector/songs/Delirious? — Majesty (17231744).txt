[Verse 1]
Am   G F   C                    F
Here I am, humbled by your majesty
     C                          G
covered by your grace so free
Am   G F   C                    F
Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man
     C                          G
covered by the blood of the Lamb

Am    G    C 			     Am  G C
Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine

since you laid down your life

The greatest sacrifice

C      G   Am   F
Majesty, Majesty
     C                             G
Your grace has found me just as I am
        Am                           F
Empty handed, but alive in your hands
C      G  Am   F
Majesty, Majesty
     C                           G
Forever I am changed by your love
        Am                     F
In the presence of your Majesty


[Verse 2]
Am   G F   C                    F
Here I am, humbled by the love that you give
     C                          G
Forgiven so that I can forgive
Am   G F   C                    F
Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire
     C                          G
Sanctified by glory and fire
