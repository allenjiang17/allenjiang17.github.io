[Verse 1]
C
  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
F
  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
Am                  G                          F
  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings
C
  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
F
  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
Am                  G                          F
  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings


[Chorus]
                  C
This is amazing grace
                   F
This is unfailing love
                         Am
That You would take my place
                         G
That You would bear my cross
                    C
You laid down Your life
                      F
That I would be set free
Am
   Jesus, I sing for
G                              C
   All that You've done for me


[Verse 2]
C
  Who brings our chaos back into order
F
  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
Am                  G                   F
  The King of Glory,  the King of Glory
C
  Who rules the nations with truth and justice
F
  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
Am                  G                          F
  The King of Glory,  the King above all kings


[Bridge]
C
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
F
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Am
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
F
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
(Worthy, worthy!) Last Time into Chorus
