[Verse 1]
D            Bm       A7       D
Let now the weak say I have strength
       Em        Bm         A7                     D
By the Spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
            Bm         A7      D
Let now the poor stand and confess
      Em7            Bm          A7         D
Oh my portion is in Him and I'm more than blessed

[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
G                       D          A7
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy Name
Bm
And with the heavens we declare
G          Em   A7
You are our King

[Chorus]
            D                Bm
We love You Lord, we worship You
            A7                  D
You are our God, You alone are good (to verse 2: 1st time)
               D            Bm
You asked Your Son to carry this
          A7                    D
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

[Verse 2]
D              Bm          A7       D
Let now your church shine as your bride
       Em               Bm         A7               D
That you saw in your heart as you offered up your life
            Bm         A7      D
Let now the lost be welcomed home
      Em7            Bm          A7         D
By the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own

[Chorus 2]
           D               Bm
I love You Lord, I worship You
               A7                D
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
          D              Bm
I give my life to honour this
            A7                  D
The love of Christ, the Saviour King
