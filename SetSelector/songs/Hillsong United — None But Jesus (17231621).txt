[Verse 1]
G
In the quiet
Cadd9
In the stillness
     Am              D
I know that You are God
G
In the secret,
Cadd9
Of Your presence
     Am              D
I know there I am restored

[Pre-Chorus]
Am    C    G      C      D
When You call I won't refuse
Am    C   G     C          D
Each new day again I'll choose


[Chorus]
Em7             Cadd9 G   D
There is no one else for me
  Am
None but Jesus
Em7          Cadd9 G   D
Crucified to set me free
        Am
now I live to bring Him praise


[Verse 2]

G
In the chaos
Cadd9
In confusion
     Am                   D
I know You're sovereign still
G
In the moment
Cadd9
Of my weakness
       Am              D
You give me grace to do Your will

[Pre-Chorus 2]
   Am    C   G       C      D
So when You call I won't delay
Am   C   G            C      D
This my song through all my days

[Bridge]
Em7       Cadd9    G      D
All my delight is in You Lord
           Am
All of my hope
               Em
All of my strength
       Cadd9    G      D
All my delight is in You Lord
          Am
