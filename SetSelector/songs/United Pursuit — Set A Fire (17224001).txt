[Chorus]
G                          C
Set a fire down in my soul
                                       Em
That I can't contain, that I can't control
                     C
I want more of you God,
                     G
I want more of you God


[Verse]
G
No place I'd rather be
C
No place I'd rather be
Em
No place I'd rather be
     C
Than here in your love, here in your love
