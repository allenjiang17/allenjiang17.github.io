[Verse 1]
Bm           A             G
  Where can I run from your presence
Bm           A           G
  Where can I flee from you
          Bm          A        G
Even if I hide on the highest mountain
         Bm   A   G
You are there


[Verse 2]
Bm           A             G
  Where can I run from your presence
Bm            A           G
  Where can I flee from you
           Bm          A    G
Even if I lie in the lowest valley
          Bm       A    G
You will find me there


[Chorus]
D                A
Deeper than any ocean
               Em            D/F#    G
Your love goes on and on and on and on
D                A
Higher than any mountain
               Em            D/F#    G
Your love goes on and on and on and on
               Em            D/F#    G
Your love goes on and on and on and on


[Verse 3]
Bm          A               G
  And if I clothe myself in shadows
Bm        A              G
  Would I fade away from you?
         A   Bm            A        G
No even if I fall into the deepest darkness
            Bm     A    G
Love surrounds me still
         A   Bm            A        G
No even if I fall into the deepest darkness
             Bm         A    G
Your love surrounds me still

Love that holds on, won't let go

Love that won't leave me on my own

Don't let it go
