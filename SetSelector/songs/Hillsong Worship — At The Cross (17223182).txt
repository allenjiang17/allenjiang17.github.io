E/G#     A2           B      C#m7
    Oh Lord You’ve searched me
E/G#      A2     B
    You know my way
E/G#       A2     B    C#m7
    Even when I fail You
A2         Bsus  B
I know You love me

E/G#      A2   B    C#m7
    Your holy presence
E/G#    A2       B
    Surrounding me
E/G#   A2     B   C#m7
    In every season
A2         Bsus  B
I know You love me

[Chorus]
E                B/D#   C#m
  At the cross I bow my knee
                     E/G#     A
Where Your blood was shed for me
                            B
There’s no greater love than this
E              B/D#      C#m
  You have overcome the grave
                     E/G#      A
Your glory fills the highest place
                    B
What can separate me now

[Verse 3]

E/G#     A2   B    C#m7
    You go before me
E/G#      A2       B
    You shield my way
E/G#      A2     B     C#m7
    Your hand upholds me
A2         Bsus  B
I know You love me

[Bridge]
              A2   B           C#m7
You tore the veil, You made a way
           A        C#m7  B
When You said that it is done
              A2   B           C#m7
You tore the veil, You made a way
           A        C#m7  B
When You said that it is done


[Verse 4]

E/G#     A2       B       C#m7
    And when the earth fades
E/G#       A2       B
    Falls from my eyes,
E/G#         A2      B    C#m7
    And You stand before me
A2         Bsus  B
I know You love me
A2         Bsus  B
I know You love me
