[Verse 1]
                C
Old things have passed away
              G2
Your love has stayed the same
              C                         G2
Your constant grace remains the cornerstone
               C
Things that we thought were dead
                 G2
Are breathing in life again
               C                        G2
You cause Your Son to shine on darkest nights


[Pre-chorus]
    D
For all that You’ve done
        Em
We will pour out our love
          C              D
This will be our anthem song

[Verse 2]
    G             C
The hopeless have found their hope
                G
The orphans now have a home
             C                            G   Gmaj7
All that was lost has found its place in You
G            C
You lift our weary head
            G
You make us strong instead
               C                      G
You took these rags and made us beautiful
