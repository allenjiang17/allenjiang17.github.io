[Verse 1]
   G
Oh You bring hope to the hopeless
    D
And light to those in the darkness
    Am       Em       C    D
And death to life Now I’m alive
   G
Oh You give peace to the restless
    D
And joy to homes that are broken
  Am      Em     C       D
I see You now In You I’m found


[Chorus]
        C                     D
And You opened the door for me
        Em
And You laid down
     D/F#     G
Your life to set me free
C                  D          G
All that I am will serve You Lord

[Verse 2]
   G
Oh You fill those who are empty
    D
And rescue those in the valley
    Am         Em      C       D
And through it all You calm my soul
   G
Oh You find me in my weakness
    D
And heal the wounds of my heartache
  Am      Em     C          D
I worship You in spirit and truth


[Chorus 2]
        C                 D
And You opened my eyes to see
        Em         D/F#             G
All the wonder and awe of Christ in me
C                 D       G
Jesus You’re everything I need

[Bridge]
G
All honor
D
All glory
Am   Em       C
All praise to You
