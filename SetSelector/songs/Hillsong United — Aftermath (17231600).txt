[Verse 1]
    D / / /
Skies lay low where You are
       Em        G         Bm /
On the earth You rest Your feet
    D / / /
Yet the hands that cradle the stars
        Em         G       Bm
Are the hands that bled for me

Instr: | Bm A | D | D A | D | / |


[Chorus]
            G /                     D /
And in that moment of glorious surrender
           G /                      Bm /
You were broken for all the world to see
       G /
Lifted out of the ashes
        Bm             A       D
I am found in the a-ftermath


[Verse 2]
    D / / /
My freedom found in Your scars
            Em       G        Bm /
And in Your grace my life redeemed
        D / / /
For You chose to take the sinner's crown
       Em           G       Bm
As You placed Your crown on me

[Chorus 2]

            G /                     D /
And in that moment of glorious surrender
          G /
Was the moment
                       Bm /
You broke the chains in me
       G /
Lifted out of the ashes
        Bm             A      D
I am found in the aftermath


[Chorus 3]
             G /
And in that moment
                  D /
You opened up the heavens
          G /                      Bm /
To the broken, the beggar, and the thief
        G /
Lifted out of the wreckage
           Bm            A       D
I found hope in the a-ftermath

[Bridge]

      Bm |Bm A|      D /
And I know   You're with me
      Bm |Bm A|      D /
Yes I know   You're with me here
      G  |G A|  Bm         G         D
And I know  Your love will light the way

[OUT]
                G  /                 D /
Now all I have I count it all as loss
        G  /                   Bm /
But to know You, to carry the cross
            G /
Knowing I'm found
      Bm            A      D / / /
In the light of the a-ftermath
