[Verse 1]
D/F#
 I know the tension of the now
Gsus2
 I don't always understand
D
 I don't always get to see
Gsus2
 Everything
D/F#
 When I'm holding up my hands
Gsus2
 When I'm counting every breath
D                    Gsus2
 Lord, all I need to know is
D/F#
 You choose me
Gsus2
 You choose me


[Chorus]
     D                             Gsus2
I'll praise before my breakthrough
        D/F#                    Gsus2
'Til my song becomes my triumph
       Bm7                      Gsus2
I will sing because I trust You
                D/F#                  Gsus2
I will bring my heart, I will lift my song


[Verse 2]
D/F#
 When I'm listening for Your voice
Gsus2
 And I'm shutting out the noise
D                     Gsus2
 I know that You will speak

Clearly
D/F#
 When I'm living out my faith
Gsus2
 When I'm stepping on the sea
D                   Gsus2
 I know You take my hand and
D/F#
 Walk with me
Gsus2
 Walk with me

[Bridge]
       D/F#                   Gsus2
He who came in power, He will come again
       D/A                      Gsus2
He who heals the sick, won't He move again
       D/F#                      Gsus2
He who raised the dead, won't He raise again
           D/A          Gsus2
And I will sing, I will sing

[Tag]
           D                        Gsus2
And I will sing because I trust You
        D                        Gsus2
And I'll worship because I trust
  D                       Gsus2
I sing because I love You

And I'll bring my heart, I will lift my song
