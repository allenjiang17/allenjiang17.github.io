[Verse 1]
G      D/F#    Em
Lord I come to You
                Bm         Em
Let my heart be changed, renewed
                   C
Flowing from the grace
            D7     Em   D
That I've found in You
G         D/F#    Em
Lord I've come to know
                 Bm     Em
The weaknesses I see in me
                  C      D7
Will be stripped away
                C/G       G7
By the power of Your love


[Chorus]

C   Em     D                   C/G     G
Hold me close, let your love surround me
C   Em   D                     G Am7 G/B
Bring me near, draw me to your side
    C Em D                          C/G  G
And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle
    D/F#             Em
And I will soar with You
     D               C
Your Spirit leads me on
       D             C/G G
In the power of Your love


[Verse 2]

G      D/F#    Em
Lord unveil my eyes
               Bm        Em
Let me see You face to face
                      C
The knowledge of Your love
       D7      Em D
As You live in me
G     D/F#    Em
Lord renew my mind
                Bm          Em
As Your will unfolds in my life
               C    D7
In living every day
                C/G      G7
By the power of Your love
