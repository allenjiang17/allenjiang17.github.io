[Verse 1]
Em             C
Nothing can separate
 G             D
even if i ran away
Em         C       G   D  Dsus
your love never fails
Em          C
I know I still make mistakes
     G                           D
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Em                C        G   D  Dsus
Your love never fails

[Chorus]
C             G                   D
You stay the same through the ages
Am                 C
Your love never changes
             G                     D                Am       C
There maybe pain in the night but joy comes in the morning
     G              D
And when the oceans rage
         Am            C
I don't have to be afraid
          G                  D
Because I know that You love me
Dsus       D
Your love never fails


[Verse 2]
Em                         C
The wind is strong and the water's deep
    G                           D
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
        Em                C    G  D  Dsus
Cause Your love never fails
Em            C
The chasm is far too wide
G                               D
I never thought I'd reach the other side
     Em                C     G  D  Dsus
But Your love never fails

[Bridge]
           C           Em                    D  Dsus  D
You make, all things, work together for my good.
