 O come to,
          Em
the altar,
                        C     G
the Father's arms are open wide,
           Am7
forgiveness,
                Em
was bought with,
                         C    G
the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes,
       C/G                      Em
come today there’s no reason to wait,
          Cadd9
Jesus is calling.
G          C/G                        G
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy,
          C/G                 Em
from the ashes a new life is born,
         Cadd9
Jesus is calling.

Oh what a Saviour,
         Em
isn't He wonderful,
          Cadd9                G
sing hallelujah Christ is risen,
           Gsus4   G
bow down before Him,
          Em
for He is Lord of all,
           Cadd9               G
sing hallelujah Christ is risen.

Tell the world of the treasure you found
