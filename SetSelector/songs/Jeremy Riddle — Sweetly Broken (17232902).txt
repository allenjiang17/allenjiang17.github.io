Verse 1:
             E
To the cross I look,
             B
To the cross I cling
                    C#m
Of it's suffering I do drink
               A2
Of it's work I do sing
                E
For on it my Savior,
              B
Both bruised and crushed
                C#m
Showed that God is love
           A2
And God is just


Chorus:
E
At the cross You beckon me
C#m
You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
B
Lost for words, so lost in love, I'm
A2
Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

E  C#m  B A2

Verse 2:
What a priceless gift
Undeserved life
Have I been given
Through Christ crucified
You've called me out of death
You've called me into life
And I was under Your wrath,
Now through the cross I'm reconciled

Bridge:
F#m                            A2
In awe of the cross I must confess
F#m
How wondrous Your redeeming love
                 A2                          B
And how great is Your faithfulness
