[Verse]
D                   A
Jesus, Lord of Heaven
Bm            G
I do not deserve
      D                     A
The grace that you have given
         Bm              G
Or the promise of your word
D                   A
Lord I stand in wonder
       Bm              G
At the sacrifice You made
      D                 A
With mercy beyond measure
    Bm              G
My debt you freely paid


[Chorus]
              D    A
Your love is deeper than any ocean
Bm    G
Higher than the heavens
D    A                           Bm   G
Reaches beyond the stars in the sky


[Bridge]
        Bm        A      G
Jesus, Your love has no bounds
        Bm        A      G
Jesus, Your love has no bounds


[Coda]
              D
Your love is deep, Your love is wide
              A
Your love is great, Your love is high
              Bm
Your love is all we ever need
              G
Your love is all we ever need
