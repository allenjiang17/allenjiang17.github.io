[Verse 1]

          A              C#m          B
When the storm is raging all around me
             A
You are the peace that calms
      C#m      B
My troubled sea
             A
And when the cares of this world
C#m         B
Darken my day
             A
You are the light that shines
      C#m          B
And shows me the way

[Pre-Chorus]
         A /F#      B   /G#    A
Oh, the beauty of Your majesty
         A /F#              B   /G#      A
On the cross You showed Your love for me!

[Chorus]
          A       C#m
Beautiful Lord
B
Awesome and mighty
    A                C#m    B
I’m captured by this love I see
           A     C#m
Beautiful Lord
B
Tender and holy
      A              C#m    B
Your mercy brings me to my knees
           A /F#         B   /G#      A
It’s Your mercy that has made me free!
            A
Beautiful Lord

[Verse 2]
         A              C#m    B
When my sin is all that I can see
             A                 C#m     B
Your grace remains the shelter that I seek
            A               C#m    B
And when my weakness is all I can give
              A              C#m     B
Your gentle Spirit gives me strength again
             A /F#       B   /G#  A
And oh, the beauty of Your majesty
        A /F#               B   /G#   A
On the cross You showed Your love for me

[Bridge]
          E                     B
And I am lifted by Your love to sing!
          A /F#         B   /G#    A
It’s Your mercy that has made me free!
(repeat)
