G         C          G      C
Awaken my soul, come awake
G             C        Em
To hunger, to seek, to thirst
G           C           G       C
Awaken first love, come awake

And do as You did at first

Come awake me from my sleep
Em               C             G
Blow through the caverns of my soul
        D         Em  C  G  D
Pour in me to overflow,
       G
to overflow

Let Your glory now invade
