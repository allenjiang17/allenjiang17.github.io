Tuning: E A D G B E


TEMPO: Medium

[Verse]
G                               Em
     Over the mountains and the sea,
                              C
Your river runs with love for me,
                      D
and I will open up my heart
                          G
and let the Healer set me free.
                       Em
I'm happy to be in the truth,
                         C
and I will daily lift my hands:
                          D
for I will always sing of when

Your love came down.


[Chorus]
G                         D
     I could sing of Your love forever,
Em                        C
     I could sing of Your love forever,
G                         D
     I could sing of Your love forever,
Em                        C
     I could sing of Your love forever,


[Bridge]
Am                   G
     Oh, I feel like dancing
Am                      G
     it's foolishness I know;
Am                           G
     but, when the world has seen the light,
          C          G
they will dance with joy,
           C       D
like we're dancing now.
