[Verse]
C
The greatest day in history,
F
Death is beaten, you have rescued me,
Am                       F
Sing it out, Jesus is alive!
C
The empty cross, the empty grave,
F
Life eternal, you have won the day,
Am                    F
Shout it out, Jesus is alive!
G
He's alive!


[Chorus]

C           F           Am
Oh, happy day, happy day,
G
You washed my sin away
C           F           Am
Oh, happy day, happy day,
G                  C   F  Am
I'll never be the same
G
Forever I am changed



[Verse]

C
When I stand in that place,
F
Free at last, meeting face to face,
Am                          F
I am yours, Jesus you are mine.
C
Endless joy, perfect peace,
F
Earthly pain finally will cease
Am               F
Celebrate, Jesus is alive,
G
He's alive!

Am                  Em
Oh, what a glorious day
                F
What a glorious way
C
That you have saved me!
Am                   Em
Oh, what a glorious day
                 F   C
What a glorious name
