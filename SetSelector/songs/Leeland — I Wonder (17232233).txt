[Verse 1]
D
At the stars in the night, I wonder
            Bm
At your lightning in the sky, I shudder
         A                    G                    D
Your glory is a blanket that covers every living thing


[Verse 2]
D
I'm in awe at the majesty of who you are
      Bm
Your love is a seal burnt inside my heart
  A                          G                      D
All of the day I want to be where you are, Holy Father


[Pre-Chorus]
        Bm                G                    D
And it feels like there's not enough praise inside of me
               Bm             G                  D
With all these words, all my heart can sing is "Holy"
          A
You are Holy


[Chorus]
D
Jesus Christ, you bled your love,
                               Bm
laid down yourself and gave me life
                                             Em
In naked shame you hung and you were lifted high
                        D               A
Here I lay in awe and wonder
  D
I am afraid, for no one's ever sacrificed
       Bm
and loved me this way
                                   Em
So on my face I fall under your heavy grace
                       D
Here I lay in awe and wonder
     G           D
Ohh, Ohh, and I wonder
