[VERSE 1]
     E
How lovely is Your dwelling place,
A           B
 oh Lord Almighty
 E                                 B
My soul longs and even faints for You
     E
For here my heart is satisfied,
A              B
 within Your presence
   E                               B
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings


[CHORUS]
           A
Better is one day in Your courts
           B
Better is one day in Your house
           A
Better is one day in Your courts
                B
Than thousands elsewhere


[VERSE 2]
      E
One thing I ask and I would seek,
A              B
 to see Your beauty
    E                                 B
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

 Your spirit's water to my soul
C#m7                   B
 I've tasted and I've seen,
A
 come once again to me
E/G#
 I will draw near to You

 I will draw near to You
