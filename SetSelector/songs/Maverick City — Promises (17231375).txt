I’ll remain steadfast

It will come to pass

Great is your faithfulness to me
         Em
From the rising sun
       G
To the setting same
       C            G
I will praise your name
Em            G/B     C       G
Great is your faithfulness to me

Em                 C
   God from age to age

Though the earth may pass away
                      D
Your Word remains the same, yeah
Em                  C
   Your history can prove
                          G
There’s nothing you can’t do
                    D
You’re faithful and true
[Bridge]
  C               G
I put my faith in Jesus
   Em             D
My anchor to the ground
   C                 G
My hope and firm foundation
      Em            D
He’ll never let me down
