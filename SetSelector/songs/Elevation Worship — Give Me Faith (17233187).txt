[Verse]
 G        D     Em
I need you to soften my heart
    C
And break me apart
        G         D
I need you to open my eyes
Em                               C
To see that You're shaping my life


[Pre-Chorus]
Em   C D
All I am,
Em  C D
I surrender


[Chorus]
 C          G        D            Em
Give me faith to trust what you say
 C           G        Em            D    Am
That you're good and your love is great
      C     G         D           C   D
I'm broken inside, I give you my life

[Bridge]

C         G
I may be weak
    D             Em
But Your spirit strong in me
C              G
My flesh may fail
Em          D
My God you never will (repeat)
