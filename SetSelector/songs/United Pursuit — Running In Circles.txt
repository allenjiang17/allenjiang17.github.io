[Verse]
          G                        C
I'm so forgetful, but You always remind me
Em              G/B               C
You're the only one who brings me peace
You're the only one who brings me peace

        D   G/B   C
So I come, Lord I come
I come, Lord I come

[Chorus]
                     G
To tell you I love you
                     C
To tell you I need you
                    Em                 G/B              C
To tell you there's no better place for me than in your arms
                G
To tell you I'm sorry
                C
For running in circles
               Em           G/B                C
For placing my focus on the waves, not on your face

Em              G/B               C
You're the only one who brings me peace
You're the only one who brings me peace
