[Verse 1]
          C                         G/B
With this heart open wide  from the depths from the heights
       Em7     D/F#  G
I will bring a sacrifice
           C                          G/B
With these hands lifted high  hear my song, hear my cry

I will bring a sacrifice   I will bring a sacrifice


[Chorus]
  C        G/B             D/F#
  I lay me down I’m not my own
      Em7          C
  I belong to you alone
         G/B          D/F#
  Lay me down  Lay me down
   C         G/B                D/F#
  Hand on my heart this much is true
             Em7             C
  There’s no life apart from you
         G/B          D/F#
  Lay me down  Lay me down
  C      G/B          D/F#
  Lay me down  Lay me down


[Verse 2]
        C                     G/B
Letting go of my pride  giving up all my rights
          Em7      D/F#    G                Em7     bD/F#     C  G
Take this life and let it shine   Take this life and let it shine

 It will be my joy to say Your will Your way
              Em
It will be my joy to say Your will Your way
              D      C                   G
It will be my joy to say Your will Your way always
