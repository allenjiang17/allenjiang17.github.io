[Verse]
G               Em7         D              C
Hungry, I come to you for I know you satisfy

I’m falling on my knees
     G           C
Offering all of me
   G                    C                G    C
Jesus, you’re all this heart is living for

G              Em7             D               C
Broken, I run to you for your arms are open wide
G             Em7                   D          C
I am empty but I know your touch restores my life
       D        C        D/F#      C
So I wait for you, so I wait for you
