TEMPO: Slow

[Verse 1]
  A2         Bsus4     C#m7
I have not much to offer you
       A2          Bsus4  C#m7
Not near what you deserve
       A2    Bsus4     C#m7
But still I come because your cross
      A2            Bsus4   E
Has placed in me my worth


[Verse 2]
      A2           Bsus4     C#m7
Oh Christ my king of sympathy
           A2            Bsus4   C#m7
Who’s wounds secure at peace
         A2        Bsus4     C#m7
Your grace extends to call me friend
         A2      Bsus4    E
Your mercy sets me free


[Chorus]
          A2             Bsus4
And I know I’m weak
  C#m7
I know I’m unworthy
     A2    Bsus4      C#m7
To call upon your name
      A2              Bsus4
But because of grace
    C#m7
Because of your mercy
   A2          Bsus4 E
I stand here unashamed (second time 2x)


[Verse 3]
  A2        Bsus4      C#m7
I can’t explain this kind of love
      A2          Bsus4   C#m7
I’m humbled and amazed
        A2            Bsus4         C#m7
That you come down from heaven’s heights
        A2         Bsus4   C#m7
And greet me face to face


[Bridge]
       E
Here I am
         A2
At your feet
         E            A2
In my brokenness complete
