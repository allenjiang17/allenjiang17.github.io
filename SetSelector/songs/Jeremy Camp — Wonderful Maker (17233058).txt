[Verse]
 Cadd9
 You spread out the skies over empty space
 Em
 Said "Let there be light", to a dark and formless world
                C       D
 Your light was born...

[Verse 2]
 Cadd9
 You spread out your arms over empty hearts
 Em
 Said "Let there be light", to a dark and hopeless world
              C       D
 Your Son was born...

[Pre-Chorus]
    Am7                G6               C/G
 You made the world and saw that it was  good
     Am7            G6               C/G
 You sent your only son, for you are  good

[Chorus]
 D5               C/G
 What a wonderful Maker
                   Em7
 What a wonderful Savior
                   C/G        D
 How majestic Your whispers
                     G6
 And how humble Your love

                          C/G
 With a strength like no other
                    Em7
 And the heart of a Father
                   C/G        D
 How majestic Your whispers!
                     G6
 What a wonderful God!

[Verse 3]
    Cadd9
 No eye has fully seen how beautiful the cross
     Em
 And we have only heard the faintest whispers
                 C         D
 Of how great... You are...
