Verse 1:
C                 D                Em
I’ve been running trying to be one who sees
	                            C
I’ve been working this Salvation out on my knees
	      D		     Em
There is nothing better than knowing we are redeemed
C	       D	       Em
I’m believing in trusting in creative hands
                                  C
I am praying for our world to bow to your plan
                  D
And this one thought is unmistakable
   Em		                   C-D
I take up my cross and follow You Lord

CHORUS:

G
When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
Em
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
C              D
And I see the sinners seek devotion
    Em
The lost become chosen
 	       C   D  Em
And I fall to my knees

VERSE 2:
C                  D	    		   Em
I’m forgiven by a Savior who did not deserve death
		                    C
He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
	           D
I’m delivered but it doesn’t seem right
       Em	                             C
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Savior who gave His life
                D        	  Em
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
	                      C
It is breaking apart at the very seams
	          D
There is one thing to be alive for
            Em                   C
And it’s to take up this cross and follow you Lord

BRIDGE:
G	           C
I will take up my cross and follow Lord where You lead me
Em	        D      C
I will take up my cross and follow wherever You go (2x)
