[Intro]
E A E/G# A

[Verse 1]
E                          A
   In the morning You sing over me
E/G#                     A
   And I receive Your mercy
E                       A
   Your faithfulness is clear to see
E/G#                     A
   It's constant everyday


[Pre-Chorus]
F#m                          E/G#
   Every breath I breathe an invitation
                  A
   To believe You are creating
   B
   Something good
F#m                           E/G#
   Though this season doesn't tell my story
                      A
   I know You'll move mountains for me
          B
   You're just that good


[Chorus]
      E/G#        A
   So I'll give thanks to God
C#m      B
   When I don't have enough
E/G#            A
  'Cause He's more than enough
C#m      B
   And He knows what I need

[Verse 2]
E                             A
  In the silence, I choose to believe
E/G#                       A
  You're working in the waiting
E                         A
  Though the future isn't clear to me
E/G#                A
  I trust You anyway


[Bridge]
E/G#        A
   Why do I worry?
C#m      B
   Why do I worry?
E/G#        A
   Why do I worry?
       C#m         B
   God knows what I need
