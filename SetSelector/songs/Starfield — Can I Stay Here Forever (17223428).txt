Tuning: E A D G B E


TEMPO: Medium

[VERSE 1]:
         G
Through forgotten convictions
 Em
Misplaced affections
     D                         C
I'm losing the sound of Your voice
           G
I've been chasing after emptiness
 Em
Trying to tidy up this mess
  Am                                Em
I swear I've been down this road before


[PRECHORUS]:
          Am                          G
I want to get back to where it all began
              C             Dsus     D
When I would long for only You


[CHORUS]:
G                    D                C
  Like a child I'll take You at Your word
                       Am                Em
As these mountains of doubt, they fade away
                D                  C            C
I'm longing to trust and love You more
G                    D
  So for me this is beautiful
C                             Am
  A brand new thought, and a brand new world
Em                   D               C            C
  Can I stay here forever here with You?


[VERSE 2]:
           G
I've lost sight of what first drew me
        Em
To the love that pursued me
     D                    C
The joy that inspired my song
      G
The friendship that was all I knew
     Em
The arms that I would fall into
      D                                 C
Seem miles and years from where I am today


[PRECHORUS]:
                Am                     G
I gotta to get back to where it all began
               C             Dsus     D
When I would wait for only You

[BRIDGE]:
        G
Can I stay here forever
 D
Here with you?
    Em
Surrounded by Your mercy
  D
Clothed in Your truth
   C          D/F#
Always, I'll stay
  C/E            D/F#
Always here with You

      G
Can I be here forever
 D
Here with You?
       Em
Can I know what it's like
    D
To deeply love You?
   C          D/F#
Always, Lord, let me stay
   C/E            D/F#
Always, here with You
