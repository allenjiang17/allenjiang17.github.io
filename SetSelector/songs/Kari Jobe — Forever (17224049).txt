[Intro]
G   D   Em7   C

[Verse 1]
G                        D
The moon and stars they wept
                     Em7
The morning sun was dead
                    C
The Savior of the world was fallen
 G                D
His body on the cross
                         Em7
His blood poured out for us
                      C
The weight of every curse upon Him

[Verse 2]
G                    D
One final breath He gave
                  Em7
As Heaven looked away
                    C
The Son of God was laid in darkness
G                 D
A battle in the grave
                      Em7
The war on death was waged
                     C
The power of hell forever broken

[Pre-Chorus]
G                     D
The ground began to shake
                      Em7
The stone was rolled away
                        C
His perfect love could not be overcome
G/B                       D
Now death where is your sting
                 Em7
Our resurrected King
                    C
Has rendered you defeated

[Bridge]
G            D
We sing hallelujah
             Em7
We sing hallelujah
             C
We sing hallelujah
                 G
The Lamb has overcome (x2)
