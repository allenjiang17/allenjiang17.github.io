[Verse]
E           G#m
Lord it was You
A                B
Who created the heavens
E           G#m
Lord it was Your hand
A                            B
That put the stars in their place
E          G#m
Lord it is Your voice
A                  B
That commands the morning
      C#m   B           E                B   A
Even oceans and their waves bow at Your feet


[Pre-chorus]
F#m        C#m                  A       B
Lord who am I compared to Your glory oh Lord
F#m        C#m                   B     A
Lord who am I compared to Your majesty


[Chorus]
             E            C#m
I am Your beloved, Your creation
         A           B
And You love me as I am
                    E              C#m
You have called me chosen for Your kingdom
     A                    B
Unashamed to call me Your own
             G#m  B  E
I am Your beloved
