[Verse 1]
G        D                    Em            C
 Blessed be Your name, in the land that is plentiful
           G          D               C
Where Your streams of abundance flow, blessed be Your name
G        D                       Em           C
 Blessed be Your name, when I'm found in the desert place
         G                 D          C
Though I walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name


[Pre-Chorus]
G                     D              Em             C
 Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise
G                 D               Em             C
 When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say


[Chorus]
               G           D
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                Em       C
Blessed be Your name
               G           D
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                Em   D    C
Blessed be Your glorious name


[Verse 2]
G        D                      Em            C
 Blessed be Your name, when the sun's shining down on me
         G                D              C
When the world is all that it should be, blessed be Your name
G        D                    Em               C
 Blessed be Your name, on the road marked with suffering
               G           D         C
Though there's pain in the offering, blessed be Your name

[Bridge]
    G              D
You give and take away
    Em             C
You give and take away
    G                   D
My heart will choose to say
      Em               C
Lord, blessed be Your name
