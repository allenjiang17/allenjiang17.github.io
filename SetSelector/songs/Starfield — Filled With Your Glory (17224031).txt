[Verse 1]
      G#                                        D#
In my heart, in my heart, there's a fire burning
                         C#
A passion deep within my soul
                              D#
Not slowing down, not growing cold
     G#                                        D#
An unquenchable flame that keeps burning brighter
                               C#
A love that's blazing like the sun
                                D#
For who You are and what You've done

[Pre-Chorus 1]
    C#     G#      D#     C#
And as the fire is raging on
   C#          G#         D#
So Your praise becomes my song

[Chorus]
          G#
The whole earth
                           D#
Is filled with Your glory, Lord
               C#
Angels and men adore
                   D#
Creation longs for what's in store
(Mountains bow and oceans roar)
        G#
May You be
                 D#
Honored and glorified
                   C#
Exalted and lifted high
                    D#
Here at Your feet I lay my life

[Verse 2]
         G#
From the ends of the earth
                        D#
To the heights of Heaven
                             C#
Your glory, Lord, is far and wide
                             D#
Through history You reign on high

         G#
From the depths of the sea
                        D#
To the mountain's summit
                              C#
Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds
                        D#
A higher love cannot be found

[Pre-Chorus 2]
    C#     G# D#       C#
So let the universe proclaim
     C#      G#                 D#
Your great power and Your great name
