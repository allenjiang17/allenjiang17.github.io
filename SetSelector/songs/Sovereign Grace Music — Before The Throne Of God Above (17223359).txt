[Verse 1]
           C         F/C  C
Before the throne of God above
                            Em
I have a strong and perfect plea
             F                    Am
A great High Priest whose name is Love
         F                    C
Who ever lives and pleads for me
           F             G
My name is graven on His hands
           F              Am
My name is written on His heart
            F                  Am
I know that while in Heaven He stands
              F             G  Am
No tongue can bid me thence de-part
              F             G  C    G | Am F   | C  G | Am F   |
No tongue can bid me thence de-part


[Verse 2]
           C         F/C   C
When Satan tempts me to despair
                              Em
And tells me of the guilt within
         F                Am
Upward I look and see Him there
            F             C
Who made an end to all my sin
            F              G
Because the sinless Savior died
          F               Am
My sinful soul is counted free
            F            Am
For God the Just is satisfied
           F          G   Am
To look on Him and pardon me
           F       G      Bb   |    |Am   |    |Bb   |F    |G
To look on Him and pardon me


[Verse 3]
           C          F/C   C
Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!
                              Em
My perfect, spotless righteousness
            F            Am
The great unchangeable I AM
            F            C
The King of Glory and of Grace
            F              G
One with Himself, I cannot die
           F                Am
My soul is purchased by His blood
           F                  Am
My life is hid with Christ on high
                F          G  Am
With Christ, my Savior and my God
                F      G      C    G | Am F   | C  G | Am F   |
With Christ, my Savior and my God
