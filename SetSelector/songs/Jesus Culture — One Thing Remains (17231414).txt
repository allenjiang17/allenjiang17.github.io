[Verse 1]

CM9               G              Dsus
Higher than the mountains that I face
CM9               G           Dsus
Stronger than the power of the grave
CM9                G              Dsus
Constant through the trial and the change
    C    G  Dsus
One thing remains
    C    G  Dsus
One thing remains


[Chorus]
         Em7           Cadd9
Your love never fails, never gives up
 G                Dsus
Never runs out on me
         Em7           Cadd9
Your love never fails, never gives up
 G                Dsus
Never runs out on me
         Em7           Cadd9
Your love never fails, never gives up
 G                Dsus
Never runs out on me


[Verse 2]
CM9           G              Dsus
On and on and on and on it goes
CM9               G            Dsus
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
      CM9          G           Dsus
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
    CM9  G  Dsus
One thing remains


[Bridge]
    CM9      G         D
In death, In life, I’m confident and
Am7             CM9     G          D
covered by the power of Your great love
  CM9      G       D
My debt is paid, there’s nothing that can
Am7          CM9        G/B G      D
separate my heart from Your great love
