VERSE:
            G
This is my song to You.
              Em
A melody of thanks for You.
                    C
An expression of wonder.
                            G
At Your beauty and Your splendor.
          G
No other cry have I.
                          Em
Than to know You more and lift You high.
                      C
Oh God of infinite glory.
                     G
Above all You are worthy.

 G
What can I bring to You.
          Em                              C
Simply a song of love and boundless gratitude.
             G
My whole life for You.
         G
You've rescued me from death.
                 Em                             C
Given me Your kingdom and blessed me with Your love.
                      G
Countless mercies from above.   (To bridge: D/F)


BRIDGE:
         Em                C
Had I riches, I would bring them.
         G                 D/F
Had I kingdoms, I would lose them.
            Em         C                    G     D
Had I the world, too small a gift would it be for You.
