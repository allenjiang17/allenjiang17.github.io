[Verse 1]
             G
I love you, Lord
           C          G
For your mercy never fails me
D/F#   Em              C              D
All my days, I’ve been held in your hands
                        Em             C
From the moment that I wake up
                G D/F# Em
Till I lay my head
        C            D          G
I will sing of the goodness of God

[Chorus]
C                             G
   All my life you have been faithful
C                            G       D
   All my life you have been so, so good
C                                G D/F# Em
   With every breath that I am able
         C           D          G
I will sing of the goodness of God

[Verse 2]
             G
I love your voice
          C                  G
You have led me through the fire
    D/F#    Em            C             D
In darkest night you are close like no other
                      Em              C
I’ve known you as a father
                       G D/F# Em
I’ve known you as a friend
         C            D          G
I have lived in the goodness of God


[Bridge]
G/B                   C
   Your goodness is running after,
      D            G
It’s running after me
G/B                  C
   Your goodness is running after,
      D            G
It’s running after me
        G/B                     C
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
   D              Em
I give you everything
G                    C
   Your goodness is running after,
      D            G
It’s running after me
