[Verse 1]
              G
All who are thirsty
             Bm
all who are weak
               C2
come to the fountain
                         Am  G/B C2
dip your heart in the stream of life
        Dsus           G
let the pain and the sorrow
            Bm
be washed away,
                    C2
in the wave of his mercy
               Am G/B C    Dsus
as deep cries out to deep, we sing


[Chorus]
G                C
Come Lord Jesus, come
G              C
Holy Spirit, come
