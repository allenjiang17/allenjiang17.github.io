[Verse 1]
C
 My hope is built on nothing less
F                      G
 Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
Am                    Em/G
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame
F           G             C
 But wholly trust in Jesus' name

[Chorus]
C/E     F     Am    G
Christ alone, Cornerstone
C/E       F             Am       G
Weak made strong in the Savior's love
C/E         F
Through the storm
Am    G
He is Lord
        C
Lord of all


[Verse 2]
C
 When darkness seems to hide His face
F                G
 I rest on His unchanging grace
Am                 Em/G
 In every high and stormy gale
F          G               C
 My anchor holds within the veil
F          G            C
 My anchor holds within the veil

[Bridge]
      Am
He is Lord
        F     G
Lord of all

[Verse 3]

C
 When He shall come with trumpet sound
F                 G
 Oh may I then in Him be found
Am                      Am/G
 Dressed in His righteousness alone
F           G                C
 Faultless, stand before the throne
