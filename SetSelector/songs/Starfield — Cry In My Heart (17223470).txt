TEMPO: Slow
[Verse 1]
          G
There’s a cry in my heart
          D
For Your glory to fall
          Am7                  Dsus   D
For Your presence to fill up my senses
          G
There’s a yearning again
   D
A thirst for discipline
   Am7                       Dsus  D
A hunger for things that are deeper

[Pre-chorus]
           Em7      C
Could You take me beyond?
           G       D/F#
Could You carry me through?
     Em7     C
If I open my heart?
        Dsus          D
Could I go there with You?
         Em7         C
(For I’ve been here before
       G                 D/F#
Yet I know there’s still more
   Am7              Dsus D Dsus D
Oh Lord, I need to know you)

[Chorus]
              C                          G
For what do I have, if I don’t have You Jesus?
             D/F#                Em7
What in this life could mean any more?
           C                 G
You are my rock, You are my glory
           D/F#    C         (vamp) Em7 C Em7 C D
You are the lifter of my head
