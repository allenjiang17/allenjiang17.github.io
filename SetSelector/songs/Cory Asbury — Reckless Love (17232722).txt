[Verse 1]
Em                  D                       C
   Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
Em               D           C
   You have been so, so good    to me
Em                 D                              C
   Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life  in me
Em               D           C
   You have been so, so kind   to me

[Chorus]
       Em            D             C                G
Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God
       Em              D                       C                 G
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
           Em               D                      C             G
I couldn't earn it  I don't deserve it  Still, You give yourself away
       Em             D             C                G
Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God

[Verse 2]
Em                  D                    C
   When I was Your foe, still Your love   fought for me
Em               D           C
   You have been so, so good   to me
Em                 D                  C
   When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
Em               D           C
   You have been so, so kind   to me

[Bridge]
Em                             D                            C                       G
   There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me
Em                           D                        C                        G
   There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me
Em                             D                            C                       G
   There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me
Em                           D                        C                        G
   There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me
