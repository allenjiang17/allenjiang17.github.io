  D          G             A7       D
Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
G           D         E7           A
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
A7            D           D             Em
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not

As Thou has been Thou forever wilt be.

Bm           Em
Great is Thy faithfulness!
A7         D           E7        A
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
A7         D          D            Em
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
G            D             A    A7   D
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.

Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,
G              D              E7       A
Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above
A7            D         D        Em
Join with all nature in manifold witness
G            D             A  A7     D
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
G            D           E7           A
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide.
A7             D              D          Em
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
G             D              A   A7     D
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside.
