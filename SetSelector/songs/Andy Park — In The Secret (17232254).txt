[Verse 1]
G                           C
In the secret, in the quiet place
Em                D        C
in the stillness, You are there.
G                            C
in the secret, in the quiet hour I wait
               Em              D        C
only for You, cause I want to know you more.

[Chorus]
G         D         Em        C             G
I want to know You, I want to hear your voice,
          D        C
I want to know You more.
G         D          Em        C           G
I want to touch You, I want to see your face,
          D         C
I want to know You more.

[Verse 2]
G                             C
I am reaching for the highest goal
Em           D           C
that I might receive the prize.
G                              C
Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside,
               Em               D        C
out of my way, 'cause I want to know You more.
