Tuning: E A D G B E


TEMPO: Slow

[Verse]

B
  There is no height or depth
G#m
  Neither Life nor death
            E
That can’t take me from all
                              B
That I find here now in you glory Lord

[Verse 2]
B
  No other powers or love
G#m
  The things of now or to come
         E
There’s nothing on earth in this life
                     B
That could ever separate us Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
G#m                   B
  Your love is never ending
                     E
To Your hands we surrender
              G#m
Where all our sins are washed away
                   B
Your grace beyond reason
                   E
Has paid for our freedom
            F#
We’re made alive in You

[Chorus]
B                  F#
  We run to your throne,
           G#m
where we belong
                  E
Every heart will sing
               B
that Jesus is Lord
                   F#
Casting all else aside
                     G#m
For the joy of our Christ
                E
Let your glory fall
                                 B  E
Our hearts are filled with your fire
