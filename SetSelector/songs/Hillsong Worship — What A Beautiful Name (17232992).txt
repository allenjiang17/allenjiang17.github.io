You were the Word at the beginning

One With God the Lord Most High
F#m7              E       A
Your hidden glory in creation

What a beautiful Name it is, What a beautiful Name it is

The Name of Jesus Christ my King
                         A/C#                    E

What a beautiful Name it is, The Name of Jesus


[Verse 2]
A
You didn't want heaven without us
(Alt: We were lost without your Presence)
         D           F#m7   E
So Jesus You brought heaven down
F#m7                   E/G#         A
My sin was great, Your love was greater
           D   F#m7    E
What could separate us now


[Bridge]
                     D                        E
Death could not hold you, The veil tore before You
                 F#m7              C#m
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
                D                           E
The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
            F#m7           E
For you are raised to life again
            D                  E
You have no rival, You have no equal
           F#m7          C#m
Now and forever God You reign
             D                     E
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
             F#m7           E
Yours is the Name above all names


[Chorus 3]

                         A                           E
What a powerful Name it is, What a powerful Name it is
            F#m7  E         D
The Name of Jesus Christ my King
                        A/C#                   E
What a powerful Name it is, Nothing can stand against
                        F#m7    E       D
What a powerful Name it is, The Name of Jesus
                        F#m7    E       D
What a powerful Name it is, The Name of Jesus
