[Verse 1]
     D                 Em   D  G        D               Bm  A
How deep the Father's love for us, how vast beyond all measure
     D                  Em - D  G       D              A    D
That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure
                      Em - D     G        D                 Bm    A
How great the pain of searing loss, the Father turned his face away
    D                   Em - D  G          D           A   D
As wounds which mar the chosen one, bring many sons to glory


[Verse 2]
     D         Em   D  G        D              Bm   A
Behold the man upon a cross, my sin upon his shoulders
 D                  Em - D     G         D             A    D
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers
                    Em   D     G    D             Bm    A
It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished
    D                    Em  D   G       D               A   D
His dying breath has brought me life; I know that it is finished


[Verse 3]
 D                  Em D  G        D                 Bm   A
I will not boast in anything: no gifts, no power, no wisdom
  D                  Em - D   G          D             A    D
But I will boast in Jesus Christ; his death and resurrection
                        Em  D  G      D             Bm A
Why should I gain from his reward? I cannot give an answer
    D                 Em  D   G          D                 A   D
But this I know with all my heart: his wounds have paid my ransom
