[Verse 1]
D      D/F#        G
I will offer up my life
   A                 D
In spirit and truth,
        D/F#           G
Pouring out the oil of love
      A              D
As my worship to You
   D/F#             G       A           D
In surrender I must give my every part;
      D/F#             G
Lord, receive the sacrifice
     A            D
Of a broken heart

[Chorus]
                  G     A          D
Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
                 G             A        D
To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
                    G     A           D
Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
                    G
As a praise of Your name
        A               D
For the things You have done?
                      Em    D/F#        G     D
Oh my words could not tell, not even in part
       Em      D/F#         G
Of the debt of love that is owed
  A                D
By this thankful heart

[Verse 2]
D     D/F#           G
You deserve my every breath
    A                     D
For You've paid the great cost;
  D            D/F#      G
Giving up Your life to death,
     A           D
Even death on a cross
         D/F#          G
You took all my shame away,
        A         D
There defeated my sin
       D/F#            G
Opened up the gates of heaven
         A           D
And have beckoned me in
