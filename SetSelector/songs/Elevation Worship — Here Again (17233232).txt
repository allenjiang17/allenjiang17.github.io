[Verse 1]
A         Bm7            G
 Can't go back to the beginning
A         Bm7          G
 Can't control what tomorrow will bring
A      Bm7               G
 But I know here in the middle
A       D/F#            G
 Is the place where You promise to be

[Chorus]
D
 I'm not enough
A
 Unless You come
Bm                         G
 Will You meet me here again
D
 'Cause all I want
A
 Is all You are
Bm                         G
 Will You meet me here again


[Verse 2]
A     Bm7                   G
 As I walk now through the valley
A         Bm7        G
 Let Your love rise above every fear
A         Bm7              G
 Like the sun shaping the shadow
A      D/F#          G
 In my weakness Your glory appears


[Bridge]
              D
Not for a minute
          A/C#
Was I forsaken
                        Bm
The Lord is in this place
    A               G
The Lord is in this place
             D
Come Holy Spirit
             A/C#
Dry bones awaken
                        Bm
The Lord is in this place
    A               G
The Lord is in this place
