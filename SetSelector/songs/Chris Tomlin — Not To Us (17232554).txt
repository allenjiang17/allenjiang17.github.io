The cross before me the world behind, No turning back raise the banner high
             D                A
It’s not for me, it’s all for you

Let the heavens shake and split the sky, Let the people clap their hands and cry

It’s not for us, it’s all for you

A                      G/D         D
Not to us, but to your name be the glory
A                      G/D         D
Not to us, but to your name be the glory

Our hearts unfold before your throne, the only place for those who know
             D                A  Asus  A
It’s not for us, it’s all for you
A                                F#m7                                      Esus
Send your holy fire on this offering, let our worship burn for the world to see
             D                A  Asus  A
It’s not for us, it’s all for you

[Bridge]
A                                         D6
The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting
D
It’s all for you
    F#m7                                Esus
The waves are crashing, the sun is raging,
D
It’s all for you
   A                              D6
The universe spinning and singing
D
It’s all for you
     F#m7                            Esus
Your children dancing, dancing, dancing
D                              Asus   A  Asus
It’s all for you, it’s all for you
A            D2     F#m7    Esus    D2
My all for you
