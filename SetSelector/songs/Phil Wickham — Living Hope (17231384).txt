[Verse 1]
              D                A
How great the chasm that lay between us
             G        Bm            A
How high the mountain   I could not climb
        D                  A
In desperation I turned to heaven
               G      A      D
And spoke Your name into the night
                 G                    D
Then through the darkness Your loving kindness
                 Bm            A
Tore through the shadows of my soul
            D                    A
The work is finished, the end is written
      G          A      D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

[Verse 2]
           D                 A
Who could imagine so great a mercy
                 G      Bm                A
What heart could fathom    such boundless grace
           D                      A
The God of ages stepped down from glory
           G       A       D
To wear my sin and bear my shame
               G              D
The cross has spoken, I am forgiven
            Bm                 A
The King of Kings calls me His own
          D                   A
Beautiful Savior I’m Yours forever
      G          A      D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope


[Chorus]
     G D               A              Bm
Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
     G D              A                Bm
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
         G            D                 A              Bm
You have broken every chain, there’s salvation in Your Name
      G          A      D
Jesus Christ, my Living Hope

[Verse 3]
              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body    began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        D
Declared the grave has no claim on me
              D                       A
Then came the morning that sealed the promise
            G    Bm          A
Your buried body    began to breathe
           D                   A
Out of the silence the roaring Lion
             G            A        Bm  (D/F#)
Declared the grave has no claim on me
       G            A    D
Jesus, Yours is the victory
