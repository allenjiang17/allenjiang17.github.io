But it couldn’t fill me
             Em
Man’s empty praise
                    D
and treasures that fade
              C
(are) never enough
 
 
[Verse 2]
               G
Then You came along
    C/G           G
And put me back together
            Em              D
And every desire is now satisfied
             C
Here in Your love
 
 
[Chorus]
           G
Oh there’s nothing better than You
        Em
There’s nothing better than You
             C
Lord there’s nothing
                       G
Nothing is better than You
 

[Verse 3]
C/G       G
I’m not afraid

To show You my weakness
                Em
My failures and flaws
                      D
Lord You’ve seen them all
                      C
And You still call me friend

‘Cause the God of the mountain
      C/G        G
Is the God of the valley
              Em
There’s not a place
               D
Your mercy and grace
               C
Won’t find me again
 
[Bridge 1]
G                               C  G
  You turn mourning to dancing
                          C  G
You give beauty for ashes
                          C
You turn shame into glory
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can
 
 G                              C  G
  You turn graves into gardens
                           C  G
You turn bones into armies
                            C
You turn seas into highways
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can
           Em  C       G
You’re the only one who can

How great the chasm that lay between us
             G        Bm            A
How high the mountain   I could not climb
        D                  A
In desperation I turned to heaven
               G      A      D
And spoke Your name into the night
                 G                    D
Then through the darkness Your loving kindness
                 Bm            A
Tore through the shadows of my soul

The God of ages stepped down from glory

To wear my sin and bear my shame

Declared the grave has no claim on me
