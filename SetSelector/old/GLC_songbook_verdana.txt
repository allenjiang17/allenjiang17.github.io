BECAUSE HE LIVES
Author: Traditional

Verse 1:
G                                                  C
God sent His son, they called Him, Jesus;
                  G                        D       D7
He came to love, heal and forgive;
                    G   G7              C
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
                G                       D                      G
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,

Because He lives, all fear is gone;
               G D G                    C
Because I know He holds the future,

Just because He lives!

And then one day, I'll cross the river,

And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,

BEFORE THE THRONE
Author: Arr. by Shane & Shane

Verse 1:C                              F    C
Before the throne of God above
C                                    Em
I have a strong, a perfect plea:
                    F                  G        Am
A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
               F           G               C
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

                  F                   C
My name is graven on his hands,
                   F                 Am    
My name is written on his heart;
                      F        G         Am 
I know that while in heaven he stands
                         F                   Am
No tongue can bid me thence depart
                       F                       C 
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

Verse 2: 
C                                  F       C    
When Satan tempts me to despair,
C                                     Em
And tells me of the guilt within,
               F             G         Am
Upward I look, and see him there
                     F                 C
Who made an end of all my sin.

                 F                  C 
Because a sinless Savior died,
               F                   Am
My sinful soul is counted free;
                    F         G   Am
For God, the Just, is satisfied
                 F                    Am
To look on Him and pardon me
                  F                    C
To look on Him and pardon me

Chorus:
G                   Em   Am             F
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One,
          G       C
Risen Son of God!

Verse 3:
C                               F      C
Behold him there, the risen Lamb
C                                        Em
My perfect, spotless righteousness,
                   F         G     Am
The great unchangeable I am,
                  F       G        C
The King of glory and of grace!

                F                  C
One in himself, I cannot die
                    F                    Am
My soul is purchased by his blood
              F          G            Am
My life is hid with Christ on high,
                        F                   Am
With Christ, my Savior and my God
                       F                      C
With Christ, my Savior and my God

I'm losing the sound of Your voice

Seal it for Thy courts above

I've been running, trying to be one who sees
Em
I've been working salvation out on my knees
C                       D
There is nothing better than knowing
Em
That we are redeemed
C                   D
I'm believing, trusting in creative hands
Em
I am praying for our world to bow to Your plan
C                             D
And this one thought is unmistakable

And I fall to my knees

Verse 2:
C                        D
I'm forgiven by a Savior who did not deserve death

I'm delivered, but it doesn't seem right

Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Savior who gave His life
C                        D
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
Em
It is breaking apart at the very seams

There is one thing to be alive for

HEART OF WORSHIP
Author: Matt Redman
Verse 1:
E – B – A – B
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

Prechorus:
F#m – E – B 
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required 
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

Chorus:
E                                B
I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus
E                                B
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
               F#m              A           B         E
When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus

Verse 2:
E – B – A – B
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath

HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US
Author: Stuart Townend

Verse 1:
E2                    F#m7 E/G# A2
How deep the Father's love for us,
E                 C#m7  B2
How vast beyond all measure.
     E2                 F#m7 E/G#  A
That He should give His only      son,
    E                 Bsus  E
And make a wretch His treasure.
E                     F#m7 E/G#  A
How great the pain of searing  loss,
E                         C#m7   B
The Father turns His face away.
    E2                  F#m7 E/G# A2
As wounds which mar the Chosen    One,
      E            Bsus E
Bring many sons to glory.

Verse 2:
Behold the Man upon the cross,
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,
Call out among the scoffers.
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished.
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished.

Verse 3:
I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom.
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection.
Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer.
But this I know with all my heart,
His wounds have paid my ransom.

Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
          A
When all of a sudden
                                      F#m7
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory
         E
And I realize just how beautiful You are

And how great Your affections are for me

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration

How do you explain? How do you describe
                                 A              B
A love that goes from east to west
                                     C#m
And runs as deep as it is wide?
                         A                                          C#m
You know all our hopes, Lord, You know all our fears
                         A                       B
Words cannot express the love we feel
                                  C#m
But we long for You to hear

Chorus:

Hear our spirits sing
                               A     B
A song of praise that flows
                                E Esus E
From those You have redeemed
                        A
We will use the words we know
     B                      E             B           C#m
To tell You what an awesome God You are
                      A
Words are not enough
                          B
To tell You of our love
                        E Esus E
So listen to our hearts

Verse 2:
                                 A                              C#m
If words could fall like rain from these lips of mine
                     A                    B
And if I had a thousand years
                                 C#m
I would still run out of time
                                  A                                 C#m
But if You listen to my heart, every beat would say
                           A                              B
Thank You for the life, thank You for the truth
                           C#m
Thank You for the way

WHOLLY YOURS
Author: David Crowder
Verse 1:
G    G/B     C 
I am full of earth, You are heaven's worth
G       G/B            C 
I am stained with dirt prone to depravity
G       G/B      C 
You are everything that is bright and clean
G       G/B         C
The antonym of me, You are divinity
G/B    C                   G         D/F# 
But a certain sign of grace is this
G/B         C                 G          D/F# 
From the broken earth flowers come up, 
pushing through the dirt

Chorus:
            C      G      D
You are holy, holy, holy
                         C    G     D 
All heaven cries holy, holy God
             C     G      D 
You are holy, holy, holy
                   C    G           D   G  G/B  C 
I want to be holy like You are

Verse 2: 
G       G/B      C 
You are everything that is bright and clean
G           G/B           C 
And you're covering me with Your majesty
G/B       C                  G             D/F# 
And the truest sign of grace was this
G/B    C                        G           D/F# 
From wounded hands redemption fell down, liberating man

Bridge:
F                       C                                G 
But the harder I try the more clearly can I
                               D/F# 
Feel the depth of our fall and the weight of it all
C                                 G/B                             G 
And so this might could be the most impossible thing
                           D/F#               C 
Your grandness in me making me clean
G       D 
Glory hallelujah

Glory, glory, hallelujah       

Bridge 2:

So here I am, all of me, finally everything
C          G         D 
Wholly, wholly, wholly

I am wholly, wholly, wholly
         C        G         D        G   G/B  C 
I am wholly, wholly, wholly Yours
                  G    G/B  C
