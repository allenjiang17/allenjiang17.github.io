Then You came along

How high the mountain   I could not climb

I’ve been working this Salvation out on my knees
	      D		     Em
There is nothing better than knowing we are redeemed

I’m believing in trusting in creative hands

Skies lay low where You are
       Em        G         Bm /
On the earth You rest Your feet

Yet the hands that cradle the stars
        Em         G       Bm
Are the hands that bled for me

You were broken for all the world to see

Lifted out of the ashes
        Bm             A       D
I am found in the a-ftermath

My freedom found in Your scars
            Em       G        Bm /
And in Your grace my life redeemed

For You chose to take the sinner's crown

As You placed Your crown on me

You broke the chains in me
       G /
Lifted out of the ashes

I am found in the aftermath

You opened up the heavens

I found hope in the a-ftermath
